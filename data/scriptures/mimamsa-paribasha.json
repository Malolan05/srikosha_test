                                "commentary": "Here, in the Purva-Mimāmsā consisting of twelve chapters,¹ the great seer, Jaimini, has discussed only righteous and unrighteous action as being capable of performance. Of these, righteous action is that which is described by the Vedas as bringing on what is desirable; as, for instance, sacrifices etc. Unrighteous action is that which is described by the Vedas as bringing on what is undesirable; as, for. instance, eating kalanja and so on. Regarding both, the Vedas, the Smrtis, and (approved) usage are the authority. Of these, the Vedas are independently authoritative, while the other two are so, as being based on the Vedas. Now the Vedas have two forms, as consisting of sacred texts (mantras) and sacred commentaries (brähmanas). Regarding these, it will be stated later on (p. 74) that sacred texts have utility as helping' to recall the things concerned at the time of performance. Prayoga in the text means performance; relating to that-this is the meaning (of 'prayoga-kālina'). A sacred commentary (brāhmana) is a sentence enjoining something. And a corroborative statement (arthavāda) is an auxiliary to that. It will be stated later on (p. 69) that a corroborative statement is authoritative as forming a unitary passage with a sentence inculcating an injunction, by leading to the impression that the thing enjoined is praiseworthy. \n[1 The word 'lakşana,' literally meaning a characteristic, here means a chapter. \n2 As opposed to Brahman, which is the theme of the Vedānta, dealt with by Bādarāyaņa. \n3 That is, beneficial. \n4 That is, harmful. \n5 Meat of an animal killed with a poisoned arrow. It is the spiritual evil resulting from the eating of such meat that is meant, and not any possible physical evil. The word also means a red onion. \n6 Books composed by sages to regulate human conduct on the basis of the Vedas, which are believed to be the eternal wisdom of God, revealed only to certain gifted persons called şis or seers. \n7 Otherwise they would be regarded as superfluous. \n8 Viz., the sacrificial offerings, the deities, to whom the sacrifice is made, and whatever else is connected with a sacrifice.]"

Of these, a sentence originating a rite is that by which one understands that such and such a rite is to be performed; for example, 'One should offer the Agnihotra' (Tai. S. I. v. ix. 1). Here the homa called Agnihotra³ is enjoined as a thing to be done; hence it is a sentence originating a rite. A sentence that enjoins, with regard to a rite that has already been enjoined, materials, deities, etc. as its. subsidiaries, is called a sentence dealing with accessories; for instance, 'One should perform homа with curd' (Tai. Br. II. I. v. 6?). Here, with reference to homa, curd is enjoined as its subsidiary; hence it is a sentence dealing with accessories. Curd etc. are accessories, just because they are enjoined as subsidiaries to a rite. \n[1. Though the verb in such cases may be in the present tense, it is to be interpreted as being optative.

                                "commentary": "Here the homa is called a matter under reference (uddeśya), because it is already known from another authoritative source,¹ and is at the same time capable of being described as that with which an enjoined rite comes into relation. That, again, is called the thing restated, when, as already known from another authoritative source, it is mentioned once more. And, as having curd etc. related to it as its accessories, it is designated as the principal matter. The curd etc., not being known from any other authoritative source, are the things enjoined here itself; being means to the homa, they are accessories in respect of it; and being used by a person, they are things to be utilised. Here we must understand that 'being obtained from another authoritațive source' in the text means 'being known from another authoritative source,' and 'not being obtained means not being known.'\nAnnjunction about. results is that which, when a rite has been originated, and there is an expectancy about its result, inculcates the connection of that rite with a particular result; for example, the sentence, 'Oné who desires heaven should offer the Agnihotra.' It means: One who desires heaven should as a means to it, bring about or perform the hoта called Agnihotra. Here we understand the connection of the rite originated by the sentence inculcating the Agnihotra, with a certain result. Hence this is a sentence setting forth results.\n[¹ Mana or pramāna is a means of valid knowledge. Here it is another scriptural text. \n2 That is, originally enjoined by some other text.]"

Br. II. I. v. 5, adapted). Here, with regard to the homa originated by the sentence inculcating the Agnihotra, an accessory, viz., curd, is enjoined for obtaining (vigorous) organs as a result; the sentence meaning, 'One should bring about (vigorous) organs as a result by means of curd used in the homa. Used in the homa' means, 'forming a constituent of the homa.' This is also called 'an injunction inculcating results due to (particular) accessories, and 'an injunction inculcating desired objects due to accessories.’"

Here a sacrifice, of which the soma creeper is a characteristic, is enjoined. Although it is an injunction regarding something possessed of a certain characteristic, yet the injunction is necessarily with regard to the characteristic also.\nSometimes a sentence originating a rite is also indicative of its connection with a result; for instance, 'One who desires cattle should sacrifice through the Udbhid' (Tăn. Br. XIX. vii. 2). Here a sacrifice called Udbhid, which is not enjoined by any other sentence, is simultaneously enjoined to obtain animals as a result. Hence this one and the same sentence enjoins both the result and its means, the sacrifice.\n[¹ An annual creeper yielding an invigorating and slightly intoxicating juice, held sacred in ancient times; also its juice. \n2Viz., a sacrifice. \n3Viz., the ingredient soma, which distinguishes the sacrifice. \n4For a thing possessed of a certain characteristic cannot be used without using the characteristic, too. Hence the injunction, although purporting to lay down the former, automatically implies the latter also. Since the characteristic is not directly enjoined, there is not a split of the sentence, which would be a defect.]"

                                "commentary": "The injunction regarding a principal rite, forming a unitary passage with injunctions regarding subsidiary rites, becomes a comprehensive passage, and since it enjoins the performance of the principal rite comprising all its subsidiary rites, it is designated as an injunction regarding performance¹; for, instance, the sentence, 'One who desires heaven should offer the Agnihotra.' Here the meaning is understood to be: 'One should bring about heaven through the homa called Agnihotra.' 'Should bring about'-that is to say, 'should produce,' or 'should perform.' Here there is an expectancy as to the process: 'How should one bring about. heaven through this homa?'-just as when it is stated, 'One should cut in two with an axe,' there is the expectancy: 'How should the cutting in two be done with this?' Then one understands that it should be done through such means as raising the axe and letting it come down: Similarly, here also the performance of the Agnihotra together with its subsidiary rites is enjoined with a view to heaven by the following comprehensive sentence, assumed from the context: One should bring about heaven through the homa called Agnihotra, with the aid given by the totality of subsidiary rites such as leading the fire, laying the fuel and purifying the altar, prescribed by injunctions regarding subsidiary rites such as, 'One should lead the fire,' and 'One should add fuel to the fire.' Such is the injunction regarding performance. The subsidiary rites taken together are also designated as the manner or modus operandi. Here the homa called Agnihotra is the principal rite, and leading (the fire) and the rest are all subsidiaries.\n[1 According to another classification, there are four types of injunctions, dealing respectively with origination (utpatti), applicaton (viniyoga), performance (prayoga) and qualification (adhikara). Of these, only the third one is described here, as being, necessary to explain the different unique results; the other three are left out as following from what has gone before. For example, the first type of injunction is the same as 'sentences originating a rite' mentioned on p. 4. The second, which brings out the relation of principal and subsidiary between certain things, comprises the second and third types of sentences mentioned there; for in the formèr an accessory is allocated to a certain rite, and in the lattera rite is prescribed for a particular result: And the last type of injunction is included in ''sentences setting forth results,' which also mention what kind of aspirant is qualified for a particular rite. \n2 Taking a portion of the Gärhapatya fire, in which the daily Agnihotra is performed, to the pit of the Ahavaniya, the fire for special Vedic sacrifices.]"

For, in order that the principal rite may combine with all its subsidiaries, it is admitted that between it and the final unique result there exists another unique result called the initial one, which is produced by the principal rite alone. Similarly, since the subsidiary rites, too, help the principal rite only in combination with one another, and since they cannot mutually combine by themselves, the combination is understood to take place through their respective initial unique results. The helping of the principal rite by the subsidiary rites consists merely in their stimulating the former's capacity to produce the final unique result."

                                "commentary": "But in the case of the new-moon (Darśa) and fullmoon (Pūrņamāsa) sacrifices¹ there is a difference. (To explain): The sentence, 'Because (the cake) relating to the Fire, baked on eight thin tiles, is undecaying on the new- and the full-moon day' (Tai. S. II. vI. iii. 3), enjoins the sacrifice relating to the Fire. The sentence, '(Indra) offered this (cake) relating to the Fire and the Moon, baked on eleven thin tiles, to those two (deities) on the full-moon day' (Tai. Ş. II. v. ii. 3), enjoins the sacrifice to the Fire and the Moon. The sentence, 'One should. perform the Upamśu sacrifice in between' (Tdi. S. II. vI. vi. 4), enjoins the Upāmśu sacrifice, and the sentence, 'The two (deities), the Fire and the Moon, said, 'Performing the Upamśu sacrifice to us with ghee alone on the full-moon day,'' fixes the full-moon day for it. These (three) are the principal sacrifices in the full moon sacrifice. On the basis of the connection of these (three) sacrifices, viz., the one to the Fire, the one to the Fire and the Moon, and the one called Upāmśu, with a 'particular time, viz., the full-moon day, as is known from the respective texts, the sentence containing the word 'knowing,' viz., 'He who knowing thus performs the full-moon sacrifice' (Tai S. I. vI. ix. I), restates the three sacrifices as a group by means of the term 'full-moon sacrifice,' which is in the singular number. Hence wherever the term 'fullmoon sacrifice' occurs in the Vedas, the group consisting of the (three) sacrifices to the Fire and so on is understood.\n[¹ They are typical sacrifices of the class called Işți-yāga. \n2 Viz., that each triad of the main sacrifices produces a unique result (p. 17). \n3 Arranged compactly together. \n4 So called because in it the priest offers oblations uttering sacred texts in a very low voice.]"

So how can it enjoin a sacrifice? \nReply: Not so; the word agneya (relating to the Fire) in the text has the affix denoting a prescribed deity, so as to mean that this cake has the Fire for its deity. Its connection with the material and the deity is known from its being in apposition to the word 'cake' (understood). That cannot be without a sacrifice, for the connection with the material and deity is impossible in any other act than a sacrifice. So they must be taken to relate to the act of sacrifice alone; for it is the dedication¹ of something to a deity that is held to constitute a sacrifice. Therefore the sacrifice, inferred from its expressed connection with the material and deity, is enjoined by an assumed word yajeta (should sacrifice) so as to mean: 'One should bring about the desired object by means of a sacrifice of which the Fire is the deity and the cake is the material, and which is to be performed at a particular time such as the new-moon day. Similarly, where only the connection with some material and deity is expressed, as, for example, in the sentence, 'One should set apart the porridge relating to the Sun' (Tai. S. II. III. ii. 3), there a sacrifice, inferred from its connection with the deity and material, is enjoined. So there is no objection.\n[¹ By the sacrificer, who transfers his ownership of the article of oblation to a particular deity, saying, 'This is given to the Fire (or Indra etc.) and is no longer mine.' After that the priest called adhvaryu puts the oblation in the sacrificial fire, which is 'offering.']"

Reply: Not so; it can have the injunctive force by changing yajati into yajeta. Similarly, a change is understood also in sentences like, 'One should sprinkle the rice grains,' and 'One should perform the Samidh sacrifice 5' (Tai S. II. vI. i. r). Some, however, maintain that such sentences can be injunctive, because the word yajati is accepted to have the force of a verbal suffix of the fifth group.' Likewise, the two sacrifices with curd and milk, enjoined by the sentences, 'The curd relating to Indra (should be offered) on the new-moon day' (Tai. S. II. v. iv. I), and 'The milk relating to Indra (should be offered) on the new-moon day,' as also the sacrifice relating to the Fire, enjoined by the sentencе, 'Because (the cake) relating to the Fire,' etc. (p. 12), are the principal sacrifices in the new-moon sacrifice.\n[¹ See p. 12. \n2 The verb yajati being in the present tense. \n3 The sentence. \n4 This is an allowable procedure. \n5 Named after its deities, the Samidhs. \n6 Called let.

I. vI. ix. 2), by means of the name 'new-moon sacrifice,' which is in the accusative singular. Therefore in the Vedas, where the word 'darśa' or 'amāvāsyä' ('new-moon sacrifice') occurs, this group of sacrifices is understood. The necessity, however, of restating each triad as a group by the terms 'new-moon sacrifice' and 'fullmoon sacrifice' is to explain the dual number in sentences like, 'One who desires heaven should perform the new- and the full-moon sacrifice (darśapūrnamāsābhyam).' Otherwise, the six sacrifices relating to the Fire etc. being multiple, there should be the plural number, as darśa-pūrņamāsaih. Restatement (anuvāda) is the further mention of a thing already known from some other authoritative source. \nAnd sacrifices such as the Prayāja, Ājyabhāga and Anūyāja, which are mentioned¹ in close proximity to the sacrifices relating to the Fire etc. that produce results of their own, are subsidiaries to the above six sacrifices. \n[1 Without any reference to their results. \n2 Three of the full-moon and three of the new-moon sacrifice.]"

Now, if it be asked how two groups (of sacrifices) belonging to different times can ever combine with each other, the answer is that although by themselves they cannot combine, yet each triad (of sacrifices) produces a unique result, and through these the two groups can combine. If it be asked how each triad also can produce its own unique result, the answer is that each triad, including all its prior and posterior subsidiary rites such as the Prayāja and Anūyāja, produces a unique result for the group. Since each triad cannot by itself combine with all its subsidiary rites, we must suppose that the three sacrifices produce three initial unique results, and through these they combine with all their subsidiaries."

Thus, it is the combination of the initial unique results accruing from the principal rites with those accruing from the Prayāja and the rest,¹ that constitutes the completeness of the principal rites, that is to say, their inclusion of the subsidiary rites Similarly, in the full-moon sacrifice, the three unique results accruing from the sacrifices relating to the Fire and so on, helped by the initial unique results accruing from the Prayāja etc., produce a unique result due to the group. Likewise, in the new-moon sacrifice also, the three unique results accruing from the sacrifice to the Fire and the two sacrifices to Indra, helped by the initial unique results of its³ subsidiary rites, produce a unique result due to the triad. These two unique results due to the triads, springing from the three initial unique results of the sacrifices to the Fire and so on, produce a comprehensive unique result, called the final unique result, which is the cause of the result (of the entire sacrifice), and that leads to the result.\nThus it is established that an injunction regarding performance is one which inculcates that in order that the final unique result may be produced, the principal rite, together with its subsidiary rites, should be performed, meaning thereby that one should realise heaven by the new- and full-moon sacrifices, helped by all their subsidiaries, through the medium of the unique results produced by them.\n[¹ Which are its subsidiary rites. \n2 With curd and milk respectively. \n3 Of the new-moon sacrifice.]"

And that unique result is utilised to produce, through the initial unique result of the sacrifice, its final unique result.

                                "commentary": "When something may be taken to refer to both of two alternatives simultaneously, the injunction that precludes one of them is called an exclusive injunction; for example, under the topic of brick-laying, the sentence, 'One should catch hold of the rein of the horse saying, 'They seized this rein of (the horse, which is the means to) the sacrifice'' (Tai. S. V. 1. ii. 1), is an injunction regarding the sacred text as a subsidiary to seizing the rein of the horse: For'in the absence of this injunction, the sacred text expressing the seizing of the rein would, on account of the indication, viz., the power to express the seizing of the rein, apply invariably to seizing the rein of the donkey as well as that of the horse. With this injupc-. tion, however, one should seize the rein of the horse, uttering this sacred text, and not that of the donkey, which is to be seized just silently. Thus the sacred text is dissociated from the seizing of the rein of the donkey. And since the injunction leads to the exclusion of one of the two alternatives, to both of which something may be taken to refer simultaneously, it is an exclusive injunction. The same principle should be understood to apply also to sentences like, 'Only five² animals with five nails (on each paw) may be eaten' (Rām. IV. xvii. 39). \n[¹ For constructing a pit for the fire. To carry earth for making bricks for this, both a horse and a donkey are prescribed. \n2 Viz., two varieties of porcupines, the iguana, the rabbit and the tortoise.

Now the proofs indicative of the subsidiary relation are six, viz., direct. assertion (śruti), indication (linga), syntactical connection (vākya), context (prakarana), position (sthana) and designation (samākhya). \nOf these, in the sentence, 'One should sacrifice with curd' (Tai. Br. II. I. v. 6?), after homa, which is known from the sentence inculcating the Agnihotra, is referred to by the verb 'should sacrifice,' curd is enjoined as a means to that by direct assertion, viz., the instrumental case-ending. So the curd is proved to be a subsidiary on account of the direct assertion."

An example of the first is this: In the sentence, 'One should divide with the ladle,' although the ladle may be taken to be an accessory to dividing in general, yet, from the indication, that is, the capability of the ladle, we understand that it is a subsidiary to a special kind of dividing, viz.. that of liquid substances only like ghee, curd or mlik; for it is impossible to divide a cake etc. with a ladle. Verbal indication, however, is the power of denoting something. For instance, the sacred text, 'I set apart (the rice grains) in an agreeable form for the Fire' (Tai. S. I. I. iv. 2), is a subsidiary to the act of offering,' owing to the indication, viz., its power of denoting offering. A sacred text that expresses a particular meaning is a subsidiary to that. \n[¹ And not to the principal sacrifice, to which the offering is a subsidiary.]"

For example, in the sentence, 'One who desires heaven should perform the new- and full-moon sacrifices,' when it is stated that one should bring about the unique result leading to heaven by means of the new- and full-moon sacrifices, there is the expectancy: how is that unique result to be brought about by these two (sacrifices)? Similarly, in proximity to sacrifices relating to the Fire and so on, which produce definite results, are mentioned the Prayāja and other sacrifices without any results, in sentences like: 'One should perform the Samidh sacrifice' (Tai. S. II. vI. i. I), 'One should perform the Tanunapāt sacrifice'1 (Ibid.) and ''One should sacrifice with the two oblations of ghee (to the Fire and the Moon)' (Ibid.). Since no results ar mentioned for them in their respective sentences, there is the expectancy: what is the utility of these? Hence, there being an expectancy with regard to the utility of the Prayāja and the other sacrifices, and (a singular) expectancy with regard to the modus operandi of the new- and full-moon sacrifices, it is decided by reason of the context, which is mutual expectancy, that the Prayāja and all the other sacrifices are subsidiaries to the new- and full-moon sacrifices. \n[¹ Named, like the previous one, after its deity.]"

Here, from the indication of the sacred text, which is its power of denoting the deity Indra, the sentence is pparently a subsidiary to the worship of Indra. But because of the direct assertions, viz., the instrumental case-ending in the phrase 'with the sacred text relating to Indra' and the accusative case-ending in the phrase, 'the Garhapatya fire,' the sentence is enjoined as a subsidiary to the worship of the Garhapatya fire, and hence its application to the worship of Indra, on account of the indication, is set aside. For direct assertion is directive by itself, whereas indication must be held to be so by assuming a direct assertion, viz.. 'They worship Indra with the sacred text relating to him,' in consideration of the fact that the indication has the power of denoting the deity Indra; but that is not possible here. Where there is no direction due to direct assertion, as in a sentence like, 'I set apart (the rice grains) in an agreeable form for the Fire' (Tai. S. I. 1. iv. 2), there, considering the power of the sacred text to denote offering, a direct assertion is assumed, viz., 'One should make an offering with this sacred text,' and thus indication is certainly directive, for there is nothing to obstruct the assumption of a direct assertion. \n[¹ The remaining five items enumerated on p. 23. \n2 And in competition with one another. \n3 Compare Pü.

Here the decision is that since indication is stronger than syntactical connection, it supplants the latter, so that the sentence, 'I am making a comfortable abode' etc., is a subsidiary to making the abode, and the sentence, 'Live in it,' is a subsidiary to accommodating. \n['Putting the baked cake in a particular vessel before use as oblation is referred to as accommodating it, and smearing the inside of the vessel with ghee before that, as making an abode. \n2 That is to say, only the first sentence is to be uttered while making the abode for the cake, and the second sentence while accommodating it there.]"

Now, wheh the direct assertion, 'One should make the abode by uttering the sacred text, 'I am making a comfortable ąbode,'' etc., assumed by the manifest indication that conveys the making of an abode, quickly appropriates the sentence, 'I am making a comfortable abode,' etc. to making the abode, that sacred text leaves no expectancy just because of that appropriation, and hence the assumption of an indication based on syntactical connection, and, through that, of a direct assertion, is obstructed, because it is delayed.3 \nSimilarly one must understand that context is supplanted by syntactical connection, position by context, and designation by position. Likewise syntactical connection and the rest are supplanted by direct assertion. Thus the (six) tests signifying subsidiariness, viz., direct assertion and so forth, have been ascertained. \n[¹ That is, by uttering the two sentences together \n2 Arising from verbal comprehension as soon as the sentence is heard.\n3 In the former case, only one thing has to be assumed from the observed indication, viz., direct assertion, but in the latter case, two things have to be assumed one after the other fronm the apparent syntactical connection, viz., first indication, and then direct assertion.

                                "commentary": "It may be objected: Eating the remnant of the cake may well come under disposal, inasmuch as it consists in the removal of a material, viz., the cake, that has been used in the principal sacrifice and acts as an impediment. But how can homa (offering in the fire) be classed as disposal, since it does not purify something that has been used in a sacrifice? For homa taking place at the same time as the sacrifice, the quadruple oblation etc. that are to be purified by the homa cannot be described as having been used. \nTo this the reply is: Disposal is purification of just what has been used, not of what has been used in the principal sacrifice. Were it so, then, after the killing of the animal, the removal of blood and excreta, which has to be done at the time when the omentum, heart, etc. are taken out, would not be counted as disposal, for it is not the removal of something used in a sacrifice. Similarly, the throwing of the black antelope's horn also would not be regarded as disposal, because, although the horn has been used in scratching, which is a subsidiary to the sacrifice, it has not been used in the sacrifice itself. Therefore, simply the use somewhere is meant, and this sort of use occurs even in the case cited, for the excreta and blood relating to the animal that has been used by taking out its omentum, heart, etc., are impediments that require disposal. Likewise, some sort of use takes place even in the case of the homa."

II. vI. iii. 3), for that sentence enjoining a sacrifice (yaga), it cannot enjoin homa. Nor can it be urged that a sacrifice and homa are identical, for the word 'sacrifice' means the dedication of something to a deity, while the word 'homa' means a sacrifice attended with offering (in the fire). Such being the case, although a sacrifice is known from the injunction conveyed by the sentence, 'Because (the cake) relating to the Fire,' offering is not known from the denotative power of the word, and hence its restatement is out of the question. But with reference to the quadruple oblation, conveyed by the sentence inculcating smearing with ghee, cutting off a slice twice and pouring ghee, offering is enjoined as a purification of it by the verb 'should offer.' And that purification is indeed a form of disposal. Because the cake, somehow utilised for the purpose of a deity like the Fire, which is a subsidiary to the sacrifice on account of directions like, 'I am pouring ghee (on thee, O cake) who art dear to the Fire,' requires disposal, therefore the act of offering concerning a part of the cake sliced off twice should be treated as disposal."

For the injunction being, 'One should perform homa when the word 'vauşaț' has been uttered' (Sat. Br. II. IV. iii. 37, etc.), homa should be per formed by the priest called adhvaryu at the next moment of the utterance of the word 'vauşaț.' The sacrifice also is to be performed at that very moment by the sacrificer, on its being recalled by the utterance of the word 'vauşat,' which is meant to remind one of the sacrifice. Hence the simultaneity of the two is possible. All this is established in the gloss' on the topic relating to 'the offering of the whole.' \nDisposal antecedent to the principal sacrifice is exemplified by the picking out of the (sacrificed animal's) excreta and removal of the blood, enjoined by the texts, 'One should pick out the excreta,' and 'One should remove the blood.' This, too, is established under the topic, 'The animal not being killed for the sake of the excreta and blood, these are not incentives to the sacrifice' (Pũ. Mi. Sũ. IV. i. 27). \n[' The commentary (in prose) called Tantra-Värttika by Kumārila Bhațța, on Pu. Mi. Su.

The sacrifice called Sviştakrt is, in respect of both materials and deities, for the purification of what has been used, while in respect of the dedication it is for generating the unique result. The same is the case with the oblation' (of the sheaf of kuśa grass) to the utterance of the hymns called Süktavāka. Since the final Prayāja is a purification of the deity in whose honour it is to be performed, in respect of that it is a purification of what is to be used, while in other respects' it is for generat- ing the unique result. The homa with fat that is performed before the sacrifice with oblations such as the (animal's) heart, is also disposal in respect of the fat, while in other respects¹ it is for generating the unique result, and so on, we must understand. \n[1 In the new- and full-moon sacrifices, this homa is enjoined by the text, 'One should offer the sheaf of kuśa grass to the utterance of the Suktavāka hymns.' Its deities are those already invoked in the main sacrifice, and the sheaf of kuśa grass has been used by pouring ghee upon it. Thus the homa purifies the deities and the material-both, however, visible purposes. \n2 The last of the five Prayājas, enjoined by the text, 'One should perform the sacrifice to the deity Svåhākāra. \n3.

Since the material of the quadruple oblation, which is burnt to ashes by homa, can no longer be used in the latter, this homa is other than what is to be used. Hence the definition can apply there. \nHere there is this difference: In a principal rite (artha-karman) the rite is more important than the material, which is an accessory to the rite; as, in the Agnihotra, for instance, curd etc. are accessories. In a subsidiary rite (guna-karman), however, the material is more important, and the rite is subsidiary to the material. As, in sentences like, 'One should sprinkle the rice grains,' and 'One should thresh the rice grains,' since from the accusative case-ending it is clear that the rice grains will be subjected to some action, the material is more important than the action, while the act of sprinkling and so on is subsidiary to it."

                                "commentary": "Subsidiary rites are again fourfold, being into origination, attainment, modification and consecration. Of these, an example of the purification called origination is found in the passage, 'One should place the fire.' Since fires such as the Ahavanīya originate by being placed on a stack (of fuel) to the utterance of sacred texts, the placing, being the cause of purification that leads to the origination of fires such as the Ahavaniya, is a purification called origination. The purification called attainment is exemplified by the sentence, 'One's own Vedas' should be studied' (Tai. A. II. xv. 7). The Vedas of one's own school are attained through study; hence this is a purification called attainment. An example of modification is the sentence, 'One should thresh the rice grains.' Since threshing causes a change, viz., husking, in the paddy, it is a purification called modification. An. An instance of consecration is the sentence, 'One should sprinkle the rice grains.' Here, since the sprinkling causes consecration in the form of an added virtue² in the rice grains, it is a subsidiary rite of the nature of consecration. Of these, the placing (of the fire) and study, we must understand, are independent subsidiary rites, not accessories to the sacrifice; but. sprinkling and the rest are all subsidiary rites that are accessories to the sacrifice. \n[¹ Svādhyaya, the particular recension of the Vedas traditionally handed down in one's own family. 2 The unique result.]"

Therefore the Vedas, which inculcate the performance of certain rites as means to particular results-that such and such rites should be performed in order to attain such and such results-do enlighten about super natural matters. Similarly, it cannot be known through perception that rice grains etc. are accessories to acts like sacrifices.

To explain: In the word yajeta (should sacrifice), first of all the suffix conveys the idea of 'should bring about.' For, since all the cases, designated as words ending in sup (attributive inflexions), must invariably be in agreement with verbs, denoted by words ending in tin (verbal inflexions), the latter are predominant. Here again, the meaning of the suffix being more important than that of the root, it is but proper that the meaning of the suffix, viz., to bring about, should first flash before the mind. Then, the verb 'to bring about,' which is synonymous with the verb 'to do,' being transitive, there is the expectancy about an object, viz., 'What should one bring about?'-and heaven, although presented by a different term, is connected as the thing to be brought about, that is, as an object, or as what is to be realised; but the root-meaning. although presented by the same word, is not connected as the thing to be brought about. For a sacrifice, which is painful by nature, cannot be an object, which is (defined to be) the most covetable thing, while heaven, being of the nature of joy, is a most covetable thing, and as such can be connected (with the action denoted by the suffix) as an object, and that leads to the understanding, 'One should realise heaven.'"

'One should achieve heaven by means of a sacrifice.' Next, to satisfy the expectancy regarding the modus operandi-'How should one realise heaven by means of a sacrifice?'-subsidiaries such as the placing of the fire and the sacrifices called Prayāja, are connected as the modus operandi, so as to signify: 'One should realise heaven by means of a sacrifice, backed by the visible help given by the placing of the fire, the threshing (of rice), etc., and by the invisible help' given by sacrifices like the Prayāja. The modus operandi is what satisfies the expectancy regarding the how of the thing. As, in the sentence, 'One who desires a rice meal should cook,' the optative suffix denotes bringing about; to satisfy the expectancy, 'What should one bring about?' the food is connected as the thing to be realised; in answer to the query, 'By what means?' we get, 'Through cooking;' and in answer to the query, 'How?' we get, 'With (dry) grass, blowing, etc.' So the meaning of the sentence is, 'One should prepare a rice meal by cooking, that is, by the application of heat, helped by (dry) grass, blowing, etc. Similarly we must understand in the Vedas also. \n[¹ In the form of the initial unique result.]"

Even in ordinary life, a pupil, on hearing the teacher's words, 'Fetch the cow,' understands their function, known as 'direction, viz., 'Here is my teacher directing me to fetch the cow,' and only then he sets about fetching the cow. Thus, by the method of agreement and difference,' the awareness of a direction is the cause of inclination. And since this awareness is, by the method of agreement and difference, ascertained to be due to the hearing of the optative suffix etc., it is understood in ordinary life that the optative suffiх etc. denote a direction; similarly in the Vedas, too, it ought to be assumed that the optative suffix etc. denote just that (i.e., direction). But there is this difference: In ordinary life, the action known as direction, which facilitates the inclination to acts like fetching a cow, is a resolve on the part of a directing person; but in the Vedas, owing to the absence of any directing person, that action is admitted to belong only to words like the optative suffix. Hence, being an action inherent in words, it is called the verbal urge (śābdi bhāvanā); and being the cause of an inclination towards matters like sacrifices and homa, it is also called an inducement or direction. \n[When the presence of something is followed by that of some other thing, it is a case of agreement, and when the absence of a thing is followed by the absence of another, it is a case of difference.

                                "commentary": "To explain: (In the sentence quoted), the verb adhyetavya (should be studied) is derived by adding the suffix tavya in the passive voice to the root in, meaning 'to study,' prefixed by adhi. The object (changed into nominative in the passive form), viz., one's own Vedas, is predominant. Study, which purifies that, is a subsidiary rite, like sprinkling, for instance, that purifies the rice grains. When an expectancy arises as to the purpose of one's own Vedas, to which is imparted the purification called knowledge produced by study, that purpose is just the knowledge of the meaning (of a Vedic text), for example, a sacrifice, which knowledge is derived from the power of sentences having words with optative suffixes such as lin that occur in one's own Vedas, and is conducive to performance; for it is something visible, and is a means to supernatural welfare such as heaven, through the performance of particular rites, inasmuch as it is impossible to perform rites without a knowledge of them. But no invisible purpose should be attributed, for it is improper to assume an invisible result when a visible result is possible."

In other words, persons enlightened by the study of the Vedas with their branches, understand, from the optative suffix etc. occurring in their own Vedas which they have learnt through study, backed by their subsidiary, praiseworthiness, as known from the corroborative staternents (arthavāda), that sacrifices etc. producing results are to be performed, and should perform them. 'Should perform,' that is to say, 'should be inclined towards.' Here, since a person's inclination comes into relation as the thing to be done, the optative suffix etc., known from study, do so as the instrument, and the knowledge of praiseworthiness comes into relation as the modus operandi, the fact of the verbal urge also possessing three parts, like the objective urge, is acknowledged (by the old masters)."

                                "commentary": "In the objective urge, the cognition of heaven etc. as being the coveted things to be realised, also takes place on account of the injunction alone. If sacrifices etc. were not means to the ends of human life, an injunction, the function of which is to induce, could not persuade a person to perform them. This necessarily proves that sacrifices etc., which are the objects of a person's inclination caused by the injunction, are the means to heaven etc. desired by him. Otherwise the injunction would just cease to be an inducement, for inducement is but an activity that causes inclination. But in the case of suffixes denoting the indicative present tense etc., since there is no injunction, which is of the nature of an inducement, the rule that the objective urge produces the ends of human life, does not apply. An urge (bhāvanā) is a stimulating activity for that which is to take place. Now, the objective urge being a stimulating activity for what is to take place or come into being, viz., heaven etc., the definition applies to it. The verbal urge, too, being a stimulating activity for what is to take place, viz., a person's inclination, the definition is applicable."

For the accusative case-ending can be justified on the ground that it really has by implication the force of the instrumental case-ending, or as a restatement of the fact that the homa is to be performed, which is known automatically, inasmuch as on the principle that 'a thing that has not itself come into being cannot be an instrument (of something else),' the Agnihotra which is yet to be cannot be an instrument.

III. viii. 3). As a hawk swoops on and seizes another bird, so does this particular rite called Syena swoop on and seize one's enemy --this distinctive mention would be consistent only if 'Śyena' was the name of a rite. Were it, however, an injunction about a hawk as being a subsidiary to a sacrifice, an identical thing would be likened to itself, which is not proper. Hence, on account of the distinctive mention of likeness to a hawk, the word 'Syena' is the name of a rite.

To explain: In the sentence, 'One who desires cattle should sacrifice through the Udbhid' (Tän. Br. XIX. vii. 2), since restatement of a sacrifice not known through some other source is not possible, a sacrifice serving as a means to the realisation of cattle as a result is enjoined -the construction being, 'One should realise cattle through a sacrifice.' Hence the sacrifice is something that is enjoined; being cognised as an auxiliary to a result, it is an accessory-'as an auxiliary,' that is, as a subsidiary-and since it is used by a person for attaining some result, it is something to be utilised. Thus a sacrifice has one triad (of characteristics) consisting in its being enjoined, being an accessory and being utilised.\nSimilarly, if Udbhid be an accessory enjoined with reference to a sacrifice, then the latter is more important than the accessory sought to be enjoined, it is something (known) to which reference is made, and it is something restated; this is the second triad (of characteristics) in a sacrifice. And these two triads, opposed to each other, would apply to one and the same sacrifice. Hence the instance cited is not an injunction regarding an accessory."

For, in the case of 'soma' etc., there being no alternative, an injunction regarding something possessing a particular characteristic is admitted by attributing to those words the implied meaning of 'possessing a certain charaсteristic.' But in the case of words such as 'udbhid,' since there is the possible alternative of treating them as names, it is improper to admit an injunction regarding something possessing a certain characteristic.

I), the word 'Citra' is the name of the sacrifice reláting to Prajāpati. In the sentence, 'Curd, honey, ghee, water, fried barley and rice-associated with these is the sacrifice relating to Prajāpati,' from the co-ordination (of the subject and predicate) in the last part of the sentence, we understand that a sacrifice inferred from the expressed relation of the six materials beginning with curd to the deity called Prajāpati, is enjoined. To satisfy the expectancy regarding the result of the enjoined sacrifice, the sentence, 'One who desires cattle should sacrifice through the Citra,' lays down the relation (of the rite) to the result. Here, there is a further injunction for the sake of the result, and therefore, inasmuch as that sacrifice relating to Prajāpati consists of diverse (vicitra) materials such as curd, the word 'Citrā' is the name of a rite; not that restating, through the words 'should sacrifice,' the animal sacrifice known from the sentence, 'One should kill the animal relating to the Fire and the Moon,' two accessories, viz., diversity and femininity, are enjoined. For if more accessories than one are enjoined with reference to a rite already known from some other source, it would create a split of the sentence. As it has been said, 'With regard to a rite already known, more than one accessory cannot be enjoined' (Tan. Vār. II. ii. 6). But with regard to a rite not known from any other source, the decision is that a sacrifice possessing multiple characteristics such as many deities, a cake baked on eight thin tiles and the new-or full-moon day, and inferred from its relation to materials and deities, is enjoined. As it has been said, 'But with regard to an unknown rite, many accessories even are enjoined in one effort'' (Ibid.). \n['That is, in a single sentence uttered with one effort.]"

In the sentence, 'One should scour the sacrificial cup,' from the accusative case in the word 'cup,' the cup, being what is most desired, is a matter under reference, and its predominance is understooр from this fact as also from its possessing utility. The scouring, however, is an accessory to the cup. For on the principle, 'With regard to each predominant item the accessory is to be repeated,' we know for certain that all the sacrificial cups that are there, are to be scoured. Consequently, there being no curiosity as to how many cups are to be scoured, the unity pertaining to the matter under reference, although expressed, is not sought to be conveyed. If it be urged that the unity does not relate to the matter under reference, but is itself a predicate, meaning, 'One should scour the sacrificial cup and that, too, one, then an extra thing being enjoined, it would create a split of the sentence. Similarly, an injunction also not being in order on account of the absence of curiosity, the number relating to the matter under reference is sought to be conveyed.¹ Some characteristic of the inatter under reference even may be sought to be conveyed, but it should be such that without its being conveyed, the matter under reference itself would not be intelligible. As, in the very instance cited, the pecial character of the sacrificial cup (grahatva) is sought to be conveyed, for unless this is done, it would be impossible to know the real nature of the matter under reference. Therefore it is established³ that, since the scouring is for producing the unique result in a soma sacrifice, an accessory to which is the species of sacrificial cups (graha), it is not to be performed with regard to sacrificial bowls (camasa). \n[1 In Pu.

Since corroborative statements will be of no use¹ if their import be for its own sake, they must, on account of the injunction regarding study, necessarily be for the purpose of imparting a knowledge of useful things; hence they are authoritative only as forming a unitary passage with sentences inculcating an injunction, by demonstrating the praiseworthiness of what is enjoined. They are of four kinds, being divided into condemnation, eulogy, heroic performance and past incident.\nOf these, instances of condemnatory corroborativc statement are passages like, 'It is no sacrificial session (satra) that is devoid of the three syllabic numberstwenty-four, forty-four and forty-eight' (Tai. S. VII. III. vi. 2, etc.), and 'He who bestows silver, which is produced from tears, in the sacrifice called Barhis. has lamentation in his home before the lapse of a year' (Tai. S. I. v. i. 2). \nInstances of eulogistic corroborative statement are passages like, 'He who knows thus has a shining facе' (Tăn. Br. XX. xvi. 6) and 'The Wind is indeed very swift deity; if a person approaches (i.e., worships) him only with the special offering of the deity, the latter certainly makes him attain prosperity' (Tai. S. II. 1. i. 1).' \n[¹ It will be of no good to anybody merely to know, for instance, that the Wind is a very swift deity; for this will not impel him either to do anything or to desist from any action. \n2 In the sentence, 'One's own Vedas should be studied.' The Vedas include corroborative statements. \n3 Representing the Gayatri, Triştubh and Jagati metres respectively. \n4 The story is this: Once the gods went out to fight the demons, depositing their valuables with the deity Fire. Fire took a fancy to the treasures and fled with them. The victorious gods, on their return, saw his treachery, hunted him out and forced him to return their deposits. Fire thereupon fell to tears, and these became silver. \n5 The passage follows the injunction about a rite called Gargatrirătra. \n6 The quotation is preceded by the injunction, 'One who desires prosperity should touch the white animal (a goat) relating to the deity Wind.']"

Br. III. I. iv. 1). \nPast incident is that corroborative statement which demonstrates something that has been narrated by another; for example, the passage, 'He cursed it, saying, 'May people kill you whenever they have mind to (or, by various devices) !' (Tai. S. II. vI. vi. I). \n [¹ Authorities differ on the definitions of this and the next item. According to Kumārila Bhatța and others, both these are narrations of some past event, the former by one person and the latter by many persons. \n2 The passage reads thus: 'Fire desired, 'Let me be a voracious eater among the gods.' He offered this cake baked on eight thin tiles to the deity Fire and the Pleiades. From that, verily, he became a voracious eater among the gods,' etc. The commentator Sāyana explains the first word 'Fire' as a man who in the next cycle became the deity Fire by performing the requisite rite. \n3 The deity Fire decided not to carry any more offerings to the gods, lest he, too, should die of exhaustion like his three elder brothers. He fled and hid himself in water. The gods started in search of him, and when they happened to come to that water, a fish betrayed the deity. Fire thereupon cursed the whole species that way. Then he agreed to resume his service to the gods on their acceptance of his term that whatever offerings fell outside the boundary of the sacred fire would go to his departed brothers. This explains the injunction, 'One should put a boundary' (round the fire with three fagots), which follows the corroborative statement.]"

Since the condemnation of silver in the passage, 'He who bestows silver,' etc. is intended to praise what is enjoined, viz., not making a gift of silver, there is no contradiction. The other three are but directly eulogistic. The corroborative statement, 'The Wind is indeed,' etc. suggests that the Wind, being swift in movement, is an exceedingly laudable deity, and therefore a rite with that as its deity is praiseworthy. It thus forms a unitary passage with the injunction by demonstrating the praiseworthiness of the deity that is enjoined."

                                "commentary": "The passage, 'Fire desired,' etc. suggests that the sacrifice of which the deity is Fire was performed in ancient times by Fire and is therefore praiseworthy, and because of its superiority should certainly be performed by other sacrificers even to-day. So it forms a unitary passage with the injunction through its praise of the rite that is enjoined. The same is to be understood in the other cases also. \nSometimes corroborative statements do other functions, too. For example, in the injunction, 'One should spread soaked gravel (on the altar),' the word 'soaked' suggests a liquid substance in general. When a doubt arises as to what that substance may be, we conclude from the corroborative statement, 'Ghee verily is light' (Tai. S. II. II. ix. 4), that it is ghee. So this corroborative statement is authoritative as deciding a doubtful meaning as well."

They, too, on account of the injunction about study of one's own Vedas in their entirety, are solely for imparting a knowledge of useful things, and not for any invisible purpose; for where a visible result is possible, it is improper to assume an invisible one. Since performance of rites is impossible without knowledge of them at the time of performance, sacred texts furnish a knowledge of things that are helpful to the performance of (those) rites. \n It cannot be urged that performance can take place inasmuch as recollection of those things is also possible through the utterance of the instructor etc.; for the restriction is admitted that results will accrue only if the performance takes place after recollection of the things concerned through sacred texts, and not otherwise. And it being held that the restriction leads to the unique result, it is assumed that in its absence the unique result due to it will be missing, and hence the ultimate result accruing therefrom will not follow. \n[¹ As opposed to sacred commentaries (brāhmanas).

And application is being related as an accessory, which means a subsidiary. Therefore, inasmuch as the sacred text, 'They seized this rein,' etc. (Tai. S. V. 1. ii. 1), has the power of expressing the seizing of the rein, it is clear from the very indication (linga), viz., the power of expressing the seizing of the rein, that the sacred text is a subsidiary to the seizing of the rein; so what is the use of (the additional clause in) the sentence, 'One should catch hold of the rein of the horse, saying, 'They seized the rein of (the horse, which is a means to) the sacrifice'' (Ibid.)? \nReply: Not so; for it is for the purpose of exclusion. Under the topic of brick-laying, there are two (acts), viz., seizing the rein of the horse and seizing that of the donkey. Now, if it be said that from the indication the sacred text is applicable to the rein of the horse, then, the indication being the same, the sacred text may also apply to the rein of the donkey. Hence this injunction is for the purpose of exclusion, viz., withholding of the sacred text (from one of the two items), meaning that it is to be recited in respect of (seizing) the rein of the horse only, and not that of the donkey. \n[¹ See note I on p. 22.]"

Now, the primary meaning of the sentence, 'One should seize the rein of the horse,' is that one should catch hold of the rein of the horse, uttering this sacred text; that is abandoned. The withholding of the sacred text from (the seizing of) the rein of the donkey is a strange meaning; that is accepted. And the sacred text (minus this clause) applies prima facie, from the indication, to (the seizing of) the rein of the donkey also; this is annulled by this clause.

For example, the consecrated cake (purodāśa) relating to the Fire, baked on eight thin tiles (p. 12), known to be a subsidiary to a sacrifice. Now, with regard to the purodāśa, which is a kind of cake, one may ask what is its constituent material; and any material without restriction may be put forward as a prima facie view. The sentence, 'One should sacrifice with rice grains,' however, restricts it to rice grains only. Similarly, the sentence, 'One should sacrifice with barley grains,' restricts it to barley grains also. Since both serve the same purpose, there is an option between them. Likewise, the sentence, 'One should use the cup şodaśin in the Atirātra sacrifice,' enjoins the cup named şodasin in the Atirātra sacrifice. Again, from the negation, 'One should not use the cup sodaśin in the Atirātra sacrifice,' its non-use is enjoined. Since use and non-use, which are contradictory to each other, cannot both be resorted to in the same performance, therefore in some performance the cup is used, while in some other it is omitted. Thus here also there is an option."

A hymn is the recital of attributes abiding in a possessor of them, such as Indra, which is produced by sacred texts that are sung. The last clause means: which is produced by the rc syllables manifested by the sāman. A śastra is the recital of attributes abiding in their possessor, which is produced by sacred texts that are not sung, The säman is a mode of singing. A rc that serves as a means to a hymn is designated as stotriyā. And stoma is a particular number such as nine or fifteen with regard to the stotriyas. These are the differences among them. So, although the prştha hymns called brhat and rathantara are meant to produce different unique results, and as such do not serve an identical purpose, yet there is an option between them solely on the strength of the scriptural statement, 'The prstha should either be composed of the byhat or it should be composed of the rathantara.'"

Therefore, in the foregoing manner, sentences inculcating an injunction (vidhi), which is another name for direction (codanā), are authoritative, inasmuch as they enjoin an urge with three parts'; words such as 'Udbhid' are so on account of being names; corroborative statements are authoritative as setting forth the praiseworthiness of what is enjoined; and sacred texts are so as calling to mind things that are to be performed. Hence the authority of the entire Vedas with regard to transcendental matters called righteous and unrighteous actions is obvious. \n[1See pp. 47 et seq.]"

The Smrti text, 'The entire (post made of the) fig branch is to be covered,' is, however, not authoritative, inasmuch as it contradicts the manifest Sruti text. 'One should chant (the Udgitha) touching the sacrificial post made of the fig tree'; for if the entire post be covered, the touching mentioned in the Sruti would be impossible. Smrti passages such as, 'The cloth relating to the valedictory homa should be received by the adhvaryu,' are unauthoritative, because, although not contradictory to the import of the Sruti, they spring from greed. \n[¹ A ceremony in honour of the departed. 2 See note I on p. 27.]"

A gift is the termination of one's own right and the establishment another's right (to a thing).  \nOf the five sentences beginning with, 'One should perform the Samidh sacrifice' (Tai. S. II. VI. i. I), since there is nothing to determine that only one of them enjoins a rite and the others accessories to that rite, it is clear that all of them enjoin rites; and since it is futile to re-enjoin a rite already enjoined, the very fact of their being re-enjoined establishes the difference of each succeeding rite from the preceding one. Hence, in such cases, the repetition of the identical term 'should sacrifice' in the Śruti proves, on the ground of repetition, that the rites are different. \n[¹ That is, repetition, number, name, accessory and a different context.]"

II. i. 2 etc.), although there is no repeti- tion of the term 'should offer,' the number 'three' comes into relation with homa, which is the meaning of the verb 'to offer,' and this proves that these three homas are mutually different. Hence here there is a difference of rite on account of number. Although three sacrifices called Jyotis etc. are mentioned under the topic of Jyotiștoma in the passage, 'Now this is Jyotis (light); now this is Viśva-jyotis (universal light); now this is Sarva-jyotis (all-light); one should sacrifice through this, with a thousand (cows) as remuneration for the priests,' they are different from the Jyotişțoma sacrifice, inasmuch as three names different from 'Jyotistoma' have been given to them. Since the three (sacrifices) are mutually different solely on account of different names, this is a case of difference of rite because of names."

                                "commentary": "Similiarly, in the sentence, 'One should add curd to hot milk; that fresh cheese belongs to the Viśvadevas, and the whey is for the Väjins' (Mai. S. I. x. 1), in the clause, 'That fresh cheese belongs to the Viśvadevas,' a sacrifice, inferable from its relation to the deities, viz., Viśvadevas, and the material, viz., fresh cheese, is enjoined. In the clause, 'And the whey is for the Vajins,' also, another rite, of which the deity is Vājin and the material whey, is enjoined. It is not that an accessory, viz., the material whey, is enjoined in the sacrifice to the Viśvadevas, already enjoined; for the previous sacrifice being confined to the accessory fresh cheese, there is no scope for the whey to be introduced (as an accessory). Nor is here an option as between rice grains and barley; for the whey and the fresh cheese are not prescribed with the same status, and between things that are prescribed with a different status, there can be no option. The accessory fresh cheese is enjoined only in the sentence originating the sacrifice to the Viśvadevas; so it is something prescribed in connection with origination. 'Prescribed,' that is, enjoined. The accessory whey is prescribed-that is, enjoined-by another sentence in a rite originated by the sentence relating to the Viśvadevas; so it is something prescribed in connection with what has been originated. And between the two, the one that is prescribed in connection with origination is stronger, for it is cognised as a subsidiary to the rite at the very time that the rite is originated. But the accessory whey, prescribed in connection with what has been originated, although it is cognised immediately after, is weaker on account of its appearing later, and for that reason does not find a place in the previous rite. So, on account of its relation to another deity, viz., Vājin, it converts the sentence in which it occurs into an injunction regarding another rite. Hence here is difference owing to an accessory. In the text quoted, the fresh cheese (aāmikşā) is coagulated milk, and the whey (vājina) is the water that is left."

Here no previously known rite whatsoever is present before the mind; owing (rather) to the cognition of an original rite-which means a different context-a different rite possessing the characteristics of the well-known Agnihotra and bearing its name is enjoined. It is not an injunction regarding an accessory to the well-known Agnihotra, restated by the word 'Agnihotra.' For, if with regard to a rite already known, more accessories than one, viz., sequence and (the duration of) a month, are enjoined, it would create a split of the sentence.\nHence here is a difference of rite on account of a different context. The expression 'well-known Agnihotra' means the compulsory' Agnihotra, that is to say, the daily Agnihotra. Thus, then, a difference of rite has been demonstrated on account of different words, repetition, number, name, accessories and a different context. \n['As opposed to the optional Agnihotra.]"

The result and its means contribute to human needs; as, for example, heaven etc. and Jyotisțoma etc. Curd etc. on the other hand do both; for, on account of not mentioning results, such as, 'One should perform homa with curd,' it contributes to the sacrifice, while on account of its being enjoined for the sake of results by the sentence, 'For a person desiring (vigorous) organs (the priest) should perform homa with curd' (Tai. Br. II. I. v. 5, adapted), it contributes to human needs. So it has been stated, 'But as regards the same sentence having both characteristics, a difference of sentences (is the deciding factor)' (Pu. Mт. Sй. IV. iii. 5).

By an incentive is meant that which leads to its performance. That for the sake of which an injunction causes something to be done, is an incentive with regard to that. The injunction about the new-moon sacrifice etc. causes these to be performed for the sake of heaven etc.; hence the latter are the incentives to the new moon sacrifice etc. The injunction regarding the Prayāja etc. causes them to be performed for the sake of the new-moon sacrifice etc.; hence the latter are the incentives to the Prayāja etc. The injunction about the adding of the curd causes this to be done for the sake of the fresh cheese, not for the whey; for the adding of the curd being done for the sake of the fresh cheese, the whey is automatically produced. Hence it is the fresh cheese, and not the whey, that is the incentive to the adding of the curd. In the sentence, 'One should separate the husks with the thin tile used for the cake,' the tile is enjoined as a subsidiary to the separation of the husks. Yet this separation is not the incentive to the tile, for the separation of the husks is achieved through the very tile that is used for the sake of the cake; but it is the cake that is the incentive to the tile.

                                "commentary": "Similarly, in the sentence, 'One should kill seventeen animals relating to Prajāpati' (Sat. Br. XI. v. vi. 3; Tai. Br. I. III. iv. 3), seventeen sacrifices, of which as many animals constitute the material and Prajāpati the deity, are enjoined as the thing to be done. Now, the first item, called touching, may begin with any animal and end with any (other) animal. Tying and other items, however, are to be done exactly in the order in which the touching proceeded. How? In the typical sacrifice (called Daikşa), since the animal relating to the Fire and the Moon is one, first touching is done, then in the very next moment tying, and in the third moment itself sprinkling; for there is nothing to determine the imposition of any interval (among them). Here (in. the Vājapeya sacrifice), however, on account of the text inculcating simultaneous use of the seventeen animals, the touching, first done with any of the animals, stands an interval of sixteen seconds-but no more-for the tying to be done in respect of the animal that received the touch. If, however, tying is not done, in the order of touching, in respect of the first animal, and some other animal is first tied and then the first animal, it would cause an interval of more than sixteen seconds, which is not supported by the scripture. To avoid that, the tying etc. should be done exactly in the order in which the touching proceeded. So here we have order according to procedure."

Here, inasmuch as the contiguity is (obviously) enjoined at this particular time, setting aside the order of the typical sacrifice, therefore first the animal relating to the pressing of the soma juice is to be touched, then the animal relating to the Fire and the Moon, and lastly the final one. So this is order according to position. The day of sojourn of the gods is that preceding the day of the pressing of the soma juice.\n['Jyotistoma' is the general name of a group of somasacrifices in which the main function of offering soma juice thrice takes one day, and is preceded by four days preliminaries. The typical sacrifice in this group is the Agnişțoma. Sometimes soma-sacrifices would extend for weeks and months, nay for a whole year or more. \n2 Which precedes that of the main sacrifice. \n3 In which one of the animals, viz., that relating to the Fire and the Moon, is to be killed on the fourth day, the second in the morning of the fifth or last day, and the third at the end of the sacrifice on that day.]"

So here the order of pouring is according to that of the principal sacrifices. Thus, rites are to be performed according to the order of direct assertion, purpose, reading, position, principal rite and procedure. Performance in any other manner will lead to defects. Let us not proceed further. \n[¹ Hence, according to the order of procedure, ghee should first be poured on the milk of the curd and milk sacrifices and then on the cake relating to the Fire. But the order according to the principal sacrifices reverses this.]"
