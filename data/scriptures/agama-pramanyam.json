There are certain people whose minds are confused by the noise of multitudes of sophisms and falsehoods which are borrowed from anyone that comes and claiming superiority for their own studies and learning, and pretending to protect the Way of the Veda,' they refuse to accept the authority of Pañcaratra Tantra which, being composed by the Supreme Person Himself, leads to unparalleled beatitude.\nAnd they contend:\nIt has been decided that Verbal Testimony is a means of knowledge in two ways: dependent testimony which depends on other authority, and independent testimony.\nThese two kinds are thus distinguished:\nNo verbal assertion can be a means of valid knowledge if it has been formulated by a person;  \nfor a verbal assertion to be authoritative, it must by definition be independent.\nThat is to say: verbal evidence which originates from a person  \ncarries authority only then when it is used to corroborate a fact  \nwhich has already been truly established by other means of knowledge,  \nand which enables the speaker to take this fact for granted.\nnotes: In the purva paksa the principal opponents introduced are what one may already call smārta brahmins, and among them especially the orthodox followers of Mimāmsa. Vedanta opposition will be discussed.\nnotes: shabda, and its synonyms, have been translated variously as Verbal Testimony, Verbal Evidence in general, or Scripture in particular, depending on the context.\nnotes: prāmāna has generally been rendered with \"means of knowledge,\" sometimes with \"criterion.\""

                                "commentary": "Now, Perception and the other means of knowledge which involve Perception,  \ncannot produce the knowledge  \nthat the Pañcaratra Tantra does indeed set forth that the desired heaven, release and other supernatural ends  \ncan be attained by means of such ritual acts as Consecration  \nand such devotional acts as worship of the Bhagavan etc.,  \nfor this relation of means and ends is not of the order of Perception.\nFor if we consider Consecration, worship etc. merely with the aid of Perception,  \nwe cannot say that they are means to realize the summum bonum.\nNot only, therefore, is Perception of an ordinary kind unavailing,  \nbut there is also no way to know that there have been recently certain persons of superhuman sensibility  \nwho would have had perceptual evidence  \nthat such acts really are means of attaining the desired ends;  \nfor the sense-organs of such persons, too,  \ncannot surpass the boundaries of sensitiveness as we know it commonly.\n5. An objection may be raised here: \n\nHowever, perception of a superior kind is possible, depending on its percipient.  \nPerception, therefore, may become perfect  \nif the percipient is perfect.\n[[3]]\nThat is to say:  \na finite thing may be found to become infinite;  \nfor instance, extent becomes infinite in space,  \nwhich is infinitely extended.  \nSimilarly, we find that finite Perception is considerably widened in air-borne creatures, like crows, owls, vultures etc.,  \nso that Perception might conceivably become infinite in some being.\nThis indeed is the uppermost limit of knowledge  \nwhere it encompasses every knowable thing;  \nfor we know from experience  \nthat knowledges exceed one another as their contents exceed one another.\n> That is why the wise can say that there is Someone  \nin Whom such finite qualities as supremacy, dispassionateness, power etc. subsist  \nin an infinite and unequalled condition.\nConsequently, this Person whose immediate perception encompasses the entire range of things that are present in the world  \nis hereby explained to be the Bhagavan  \nwho has immediate perceptual knowledge that Consecration, worship and so forth are dharma.  \nSo what remains unproved? (is improper).\n6. This objection is thus refuted: \n\nThe supreme perceptual knowledge which you assume is just a fancy.  \nPerceptual knowledge can never go beyond its own sphere and trespass on another.\nFor instance:  \nA superior kind of visual perception,  \nas well as a superior perceptible object,  \nmust necessarily occur in loci  \nwhere inherent relations of one kind,  \nas between colour and coloured, obtain in one object.\n[[4]]  \nNo knowledge that is received through one of the senses \ncan encompass all that is knowable through all senses.  \nSo how can perceptual knowledge by itself  \nmake all things known,  \ni.e. also things known only through other means of ... knowledge?\n7. The objector resumes:   \nHowever, the sensitivity which we attribute to Perception  \nis directed toward the perceiving of what exists at present.\nOf course, if Perception did not have this function of perceiving what exists at present as its natural function,  \nit would cease to be Perception at all.  \n\nTherefore, it is not reasonable to say  \nthat a superior kind of Perception,  \ndefined as encompassing all objects,  \nis a priori impossible  \nbecause it is limited to being Perception!\n8\\. The objection is refuted:  \nIf from finite Perception you conclude to infinite Perception,  \nthen I ask you to explain:  \ncan a finite quantity ever attain to such expansion that it cannot be further expanded?  \nYou insist, as it were, on full maturity in a little boy!  \neven as a boy, after attaining the full growth, cannot grow physically further?'\nThere are two possibilities:  \neither the infinite exists in the finite,  \nor the finite gradually becomes infinite.\nThe former cannot stand,  \nfor there is no Perception to support it:  \nwe have never seen a bowl or a similar finite object  \nwhich had the same expansion as space.\n[[5]]\nAnd suppose a finite quantity could assume inconceivable infinitude:  \nwhy, then any single jar or pitcher could fill up the entire space within the Egg of Brahma,  \nso that all other things would be pushed out and perish accordingly!\nIf you take space itself as the subject,  \nyou merely prove the proved.  \n\nIn the alternative  \nyou cannot avoid the illogicality we have pointed out:\nas a matter of fact,  \nnever before has anybody seen a finite pillar  \nwhich was pervaded by an infinite pillar  \nConsequently, there remains the defect of \nmutual exclusion.\nLet us also consider your illustration,  \nnamely that in space we have an example of a finite extent becoming infinite.  \nExtent is by definition a limited extension of space, a relative quantity,  \nsomething that can be entirely circumscribed.\nExtent in this definition does not subsist in space as such,  \nso how can you adduce it as an example?\nBesides, if one were to infer extent in space,  \none would simultaneously infer the possibility that space might be surpassed in extent by another quantity.  \nAnd so the illustration again falls short of the thesis.\nNor is there any evidence for the thesis  \nthat a superior perception reveals that Consecration, worship etc. are actually dharma.\nnotes: jagati or toke??: \"in the world of experience, in common experience.\"\nnotes: Punctuate after iti which closes the question introduced in prsto vyācasṭām;  \nabhi-ni-vis \"to stick to a partisan view (in the teeth of contrary evidence).\"  \nI take bala iva as sandhi for bāle iva,  \nthe meaning being that the objector takes the view that  \nsomething limited (the boy) is really unlimited (mature adult).\nnotes: siddhasadhana, one of the defects of an argumentation  \nby which proof is sought of that which is already proved or established.  \nSpace (akāta) is, by definition, unlimited  \nand cannot illustrate the thesis that something finite can be infinite.\nnotes: vibhu in the sense of \"omnipresent, infinite.\""

                                "commentary": "10\\. Nor do we find scriptural evidence which sets forth  \nthat the performance of all the rites which are established in the Satvata doctrine is mandatory;  \nsuch evidence would have proved that the Pañcaratra Tradition,  \nbeing based upon this mandate,  \ncarried authority.\nNor is it possible, in the absence of explicit revelation,  \nto infer such evidence from Scripture.  \nFor just as the relation of means to certain ends which are their fruits, e.g., heaven, as Pafcarātra maintains Consecration, worship etc. to be,  \ndoes not allow of being inferred  \nbecause no such relation can be (determined) ~~verified by Perception~~,\njust so, no scriptural authority to furnish the basis of such a relation  \ncan be inferred from Scripture.\nNor is any verbal testimony  \ncapable of providing valid knowledge  \nthat Scripture is the basis of the Tradition concerned -  \nVerbal testimony is of two kinds,  \noriginating from a person  \nor not originating from a person.\nPersonal speech cannot be proof of it,  \nfor persons may lie in order to deceive their hearers.\nFor even today, we find philosophers  \nwho pretend to be scriptural  \nand yet expound an interpretation which is wholly unscriptural.\n[[7]]  \nSo we have our doubts whether the claim made by the authors of the Pañcaratra texts  \nthat their own compositions are founded in the Veda  \nis really the result of an honest conviction  \nthat such is indeed the case,  \nor nothing but the self-glorification of authors  \nwho write as their fancy takes them!\nThis argumentation by itself suffices to disprove the contended authority of Pañcarātra,  \nfor there is no eternal Scripture to support the claim.\nNor can Analogy prove that Scripture is its basis,  \nfor this criterion cannot be properly applied;  \nfor how could the proof we need,  \nwhich cannot be found by the other means of knowledge,  \nbe within the scope of the mere knowledge of similitude?\nNor can it be argued that,  \nsince the Tradition cannot be proved by other means,  \nImplication proves that Scripture is its basis.\n\nThe argument is as follows,  \ncircumstantial Implication must prove the tradition,  \nas it cannot be proved otherwise.  \n…\nthe authors of the Pañcaratra, clearly have this tradition  \nthat Consecration, worship, etc. are dharma  \nand this tradition is comparable to the tradition of Manu and others  \nthat certain non-Vedic rites, as the astaka etc., are dharma;\nnow there can be no tradition of a fact unless that fact has been cognized before;\nbut here we have the tradition of a fact  \nthat cannot be proved by Perception, Inference, Verbal Testimony or Analogy;\ntherefore the cognition of the fact can only have originated from Scripture...\n[[8]]  \nHowever, this argument would only prove its point  \nif there were any authority for the assumption  \nthat cognitions are invariably true.\nBut when certain notions which are produced by the false cognitions of people  \nwhose judgement is clouded by hatred, prejudice and obstinacy,  \ncause such \"traditions\" to be written in accordance with these false cognitions,  \ncould these traditions possibly be true?\n11\\. Here an objection may be raised: \n\n> However, the same arguments may be advanced  \n> against the authority of the traditions of Manu etc.  \n> The observation of the aṣṭaka rite does not produce any perceptual knowledge  \n> that this rite is indeed a means to realize the postulated end.\n> Nor can it be inferred,  \n> because no relation is perceptually given.  \nNor is there any scriptural evidence for it,  \nfor it cannot be found. Nor is there any scriptural evidence for it, for it cannot be found.\nNor again can such evidence be inferred from Scripture  \nwhere it is not found explicitly,  \nbecause no relation is perceptually given.\nNor can it be proved, through Analogy,  \nas there is no apparent analogue.\nNor through circumstantial Implication,  \nbecause of the reasons given above  \nagainst the argument that it is otherwise unprovable.\nNow, if it is legitimate in one case  \nto presume scriptural authority in support of it  \nbecause there happens to be a well-established tradition about it among Vedic experts,  \nwell, in Pancarãtra, too, …\ngreat sages are traditionally known  \nas the founders of the sacred transmission,  \nsages like Narada, Sanḍilya and others.\n> The same objections and the same justifications  \ncan be advanced about both the tradition of Manu etc. and the tradition of Pancarātra.  \nEither both are authoritative or neither is.  \n> There are no grounds to show that the two traditions differ in some essential respect.\n[[9]]  \nEither we must reject the authority of Manu's tradition as well,  \nor we must indeed show in which respect the Pancarãtra tradition is different from Manu's.\n12\\. This objection is refuted: \nין \nThe author of the Sutras, by making the Sutra: \n\n> \"Tradition is also valid,  \n> because it has the same agent as Scripture\", \n\nhas clearly indicated that in his opinion  \nno essential difference exists between Scriptural and Traditional validity.\nAccordingly, we find that those who are qualified for the three Vedas  \nperform equally for purposes of higher benefits both the ritual acts which are enjoined by Scripture (e.g., agnihōtra, pūrṇaderšamāsa, ivolistoma,etc.)  \nand the ritual acts enjoined by Tradition (e.g., aṣṭakā, ācamana, sandhya worship, etc.),  \nbecause they have been instructed in both varieties of acts by their fathers or preceptors.\nThe firmness with which so highly qualified exemplary persons  \nhave adopted these traditional rites as incumbent upon the three higher estates  \ngoes to show that the knowledge  \nthat rites of this kind, astaka etc., obviously found to exist, are mandatory \nultimately derives from Scripture itself.\nOn the other hand, we find that those who observe the scriptural rites of agnihotra etc.  \ndo not observe the Tantric customs in the same manner as they observe such traditional customs as acamana investiture with the sacred thread etc.\nOn the contrary, the Vedic experts condemn those who do.\nIt follows that the validity which we attribute to different Traditions  \n\"because\", as the Sutra says, \"they have the same agent as Scripture\", cannot well apply  \nto heterodox Traditions as the Pañcaratra;  \nfor exemplary exponents of the three estates  \ndo not accept the doctrines of Traditions of this kind.\n13\\. OBJECTION:  \nNevertheless, the fact that Bhāgavata Brahmins,  \nwho wear the hair-tuft, the sacred thread etc. prescribed in Scripture,  \nperform daily the rites of Pañcarātra  \nshould then justify the presumption  \nthat these rites likewise ultimately derive from the Veda.  \nOn what grounds, then, are we to assume  \nthat this same Pañcarātra Tradition really has its origins in error, deceit and the like,  \nthe very negation of valid authority?.\n14\\. REFUTATION:  \n\nWe reply: Well! So you really argue that the Bhāgavatas,  \nwho are hated by the three estates,  \nare exemplary and hence authoritative?!\nObjection:  \nBut they are Brahmins,  \nand Brahmins are considered to be the highest estate:  \nwhy should they not be exemplary?\nRefutation:  \nBrahmins? Far from it!\nWe do not regard Brahmins as a distinct species,  \ndifferent from the species man,  \nwith specific characteristics which mere sensory perception permits us to recognize as present in some specific bodies  \nand absent in others.\nHair-tuft, sacred thread etc. which are prescribed for Brahmins and the other two estates,  \ndo not make a man a Brahmin.  \nNor do they demonstrate that a man is a Brahmin,  \nfor we see them worn illegally by blackguards, outcastes and the like.  \n[[11]]  \nTherefore, the sole criterion by which we can tell whether a man is indeed a Brahmin  \nis acceptance of undisputed expressions by older persons,  \nwhich give us irrefutable proof.\nNor do ordinary people, use without hesitation the term Brahmin to describe Bhāgavatas.\nThere is also a distinct difference in the two appellations: here Brahmins, there Bhāgavatas.\n15\\. OBJECTION: \n\n> The people do not use the word Brahmin' to refer to Bhāgavatas.  \n> The reference is only difference as this much Brahmins and this much Bhāgavatas.  \n> Be that as it may, still, the appellations Satvata, Bhāgavata etc. are also used to name Brahmins,  \n> by some sort of transference of properties, just as the word parivrajaka is used to designate a Brahmin.\nREFUTATION: The argument is false.\nPersons of certain inferior castes are commonly referred to as Satvatas; \nthe name is used to denote these castes,  \nand not anything else.\nThe grammarians have the rule  \nthat it is improper to use a certain word in its etymological sense  \nif it can also be taken in a customary sense which is more common, e.g., rathakāra.\nIf there were no such rule,  \nhow could the word *rathakara give up its etymological meaning of \"chariotmaker\" to become the name of a particular caste,  \neven to the extent of cancelling all connotations which we have learnt?\nSimilarly, Satvata refers to a person who has been born from a vrutya vaishya  \nand belongs to the lowest castes,  \nand is thus excluded from the sacraments of initiation, etc.\nManu (Manu 10.23.) says: \n\n> \"The issue of a vaisya vratya extraction  \n> is called Sudhanvā or Bharuşa or Nijangha or Maitra or Satvata\" \"\n[[12]]\n\nIt cannot be disputed  \nthat Bhagavata is another name for Satvata;\nSmrti has it that \n\n> \"the fifth, called Satvata,  \n> worships the temples and sanctuaries of Viṣṇu by royal decree;  \n> he is also called Bhagavata.\"\nThe Smrti thus describes which profession the descendants of the said vratya vaisya pursue  \nand with our own eyes we indeed see them pursue this profession.\nThus Uśanas: \n\n> \"They all live by the plough and the sword,  \n> the Acaryas and the Satvatas live on the worship of the Deity.\"\nSimilarly, in the Brahma Purāṇa-\n\n\"He worships the sanctuaries of Visnu by royal decree.\"\nElsewhere (unidentified) the same is stated thus: \n\n> \"The profession of the Satvatas  \n> is to clean up the sanctuaries of the Deity  \n> and the eatables offered to the idol, \n> as well as to guard it.\"\nAnd, to dispel the last doubt about the sort of people they are,  \nManu (Manu 10.40) declares: \n\n> \"Whether disguised or not, they can be known by their deeds.\"\n16\\. Their conduct, moreover, proves that they cannot be Brahmins.  \nFor a living they perform pūjā to the Deity, undergo their Consecration,  \neat themselves the food which is offered to the idols\nobserve deviating sacraments-  \nfrom the prenatal garbhadhāna rite to the funerary rituals-,  \nomit to perform the shrauta ritual  \nand avoid contact with Brahmins.\nThese and other habits show conclusively that they cannot be Brahmins.\nSmrtis declare that the reason of their disqualification for Vedic rites  \nis this that they perform pūjā to the Deity in order to earn a living:\n[[13]]  \n\"Those who from generation to generation  \nhave worshipped the Deity professionally  \nare disqualified for the study of the Veda,  \nfor participation in the sacrifices  \nand for officiating in sacrifices.\"\nTheir own Parama Samhita states the same prohibition: \n\n> \"Whether in disaster or emergency,  \n> in terror or in straits,  \n> one must never worship the God of gods for a living.\"\nSuch habits as wearing the garlands that are offered to the God  \nand eating the food that is presented to the idol  \nand other practices of that kind, which are condemned by all right-thinking people,  \nshows plainly that they are not Brahmins.\nFurthermore, we wonder how it can be presumed  \nthat the authority of these people proves  \nthat Scripture is the basis of their way of life:  \nat the mere sight of them  \nall respectable men perform expiatory rites such as candrayana\nSmrti declares that if one sets eyes on a devalaka,  \nit is necessary to perform an expiation.\nA devalaka is someone who lives on temple treasure  \nand worships the idol for a livelihood.\nThus Devala:  \n\"One who lives on temple treasure. is called a devalaka.\"\nLikewise:  \n\n> \"A Brahmin who has worshipped the deity for three years  \n> in order to make a living is called a devalaka  \n> and he is held to be unworthy to partake in any ritual.\"\nThose who have been known to worship the God as a hereditary profession are automatically regarded as devalakas.\nThe rite of expiation is set forth in the precept: \n\n> \"A Brahmin who is taking his meal should not look at ordure, a pig, a eunuch, a sacrificial pole, a devalaka or a corpse;  \n> if he does he must observe the candrayana.\"\nAtri, too, very explicitly declares that they are not Brahmins: \n\n> \"The Avalukas, Devalakas, Kalpadevalakas, Ganabhogadevalakas and fourthly those of the Bhagavata profession are corrupt Brahmins.\"\"\n[[14]]  \nAlso the venerable Vyasa: \n\n> \"The Ahvāyakas, Devalakas, Nakṣatragrāmayājakas and Mahapathikas are outcaste Brahmins.\" 15\nnotes: Yamuna throughout treats Satvata and Bhāgavata as \nsynonymous.\nnotes: pauruşėya and apauruseya;  \nthe latter has in the sequel been rendered with \"preterpersonal.\"  \nPerson here does not mean only \"human person\"  \nbut \"any being endowed with personal features, including God.\" \n\n\"Eternal Scripture\" (āgama) is preter-personal scripture,  \nsince any verbal statement originating from a person is cotemporal with that person,  \nand the purvapaksin does not admit the existence of an eternal personal deity.\nnotes: Implication - namely, the relation of being a means to a certain end.\n\narthapatti, throughout translated \"circumstantial-implication\".  \nIt is a kind of inference  \nby which is established something  \nthat must be established,  \nyet is not established by another means of knowledge; for example:  \n\"Devadatta, who is well-fed,  \ndoes not eat by day:\"  \nsince he cannot be well-fed without eating at all,  \nit is deduced, by circumstantial implication, that he eats by night.\nnotes: KMS 1.3.2 api od kartrsamanyāt pramāṇam anumānam syat - \"smr̥ti is authoritative, because both smr̥ti and Veda have the same agent performing its mandates,\"\n\naştaka is the name of the 8th day after Full Moon in the winter and śiśira months,  \non which an oblation is performed for the deceased (Manu 4.119; 150).\nnotes: The morning and evening oblations, the New and Full Moon oblations, and the soma sacrifice,  \nexamples respectively of nitya (daily recurring), naimittika (occasional) and kamya (desiderative) rites.\n\nsandhya worship = the crepuscular observances.\nnotes: The point is taken up in detail infra §§ 119 f.\nnotes: Respectively yoga, whereby the component parts of the word are given their own meaning;  \nand rūḍhi, the total meaning of a word that has become conventional  \nand does not necessarily correspond to the meanings of its [[125]]component parts.  \n\nRathakara means by yoga \"chariot-maker, cartwright.\" by rūḍhi a caste which is not at all characterized by this profession\nnotes: adhyayanasiddhabuddhyangato??abkangenāpi.  \nSuch a \"connotation\" is, for example, that the rathakara in the literal sense of cartwright  \nis disqualified for Vedic ritual,  \nbecause a cartwright is a śūdra;  \non this point see infra.\nnotes: upanayana, which is the first step to his acquisition of Vedic knowledge.\nnotes: the term \"by royal decree\" shows that it is a caste profession. Quotation not identified\nnotes: not found in Ausanasasmrti (AAS 48).\nnotes: This point is detailed upon infra § 134 f\nnotes: not in Devalasmr̥ti.\nnotes: not in Atrismr̥ti:  \nAvaluka is unknown to me.  \nkalpa devalaka can be explained as a professional kalpa priest,  \nkalpa either in the sense of (\"unorthodox) ritual,\" or 'astrological mansion\"; gapabhogadevalaka is likewise obscure,  \nbut probably refers to unorthodox priest engaged in gap??a worship."

                                "commentary": "DISCURSUS: \n\n18\\. At this point someone interjects:  \nIf you please, by all means assume that the Vedas constitute the cause  \nof the delegated and indirect authority of the Tradition of Manu etc.\nBut is there any reason why we should have to depend exclusively on the Veda  \nas the basis of the Pañcarātra tradition too?  \nThe same direct knowledge which is the very foundation of the authority of the Vedas themselves  \nis also the foundation of the authority of the Pañcarâtra doctrine;  \n\nthe authority of the latter is not based upon the relation of supporting authority  \nand supported authority which characterizes typical smarta injunctions,\ne.g., astakā and acamana which have their common basis in the Veda. \nIn fact, the two traditions of the aştaka rite and the acamana rite are not interdependent, but, they are equally and independently authoritative.\n> Similarly, Pañcarātra and Scripture are not interdependent.\nIf Pancaratra collapses as soon as it is denied the support of the Veda,  \nwhy then should the Veda not collapse when the support of Pañcaratra is taken away from it?\n19\\. The Vedas derive their authority  \nfrom direct knowledge which originates from a person  \nand must therefore naturally derive from a person?\nWho can doubt it?  \nFor we perceive that words, from their very nature, depend for their composition  \non some entity that is different from themselves. \n\n[[17]]  \nHow else could they exist at all?\nIf it is objected that \n\n> the significance of the Book called Veda  \njust consists in this that  \nit does in fact exist as Word \nthough nobody has composed it, \n\nthen we reply;\nwhy, if this were true,  \nthen the significance of smoke on a mountain consists in this  \nthat it whirls irrepressibly sky-high without fire!  \nIt is utterly out of the question.\n>> 20\\. OBJECTION. But since the applicability' of the dharma  \n> cannot be shown by any of the means of knowledge,  \n> how can a book on it be composed?   \n>\n> REPLY. Don't argue like that:  \n> for the Bhagavan who, of course, has an immediate intuition of dharma and adharma  \n> through the knowledge which is natural to Him  \n> has had this Book called Veda composed out of compassion for the world.\n21\\. OBJECTION. But does this intuition or perception also encompass dharma and adharma?\n> REPLY. Certainly. How else would the Bhagavān be able to give rise to such effects as body, world etc.?\nFor the maker of such effects must be one who is capable of perceiving their material and instrumental causes.\nNow, dharma and adharma are the instrumental causes of the world;  \nthis is also the consensus of the Mimāmsakas. \n\nConsequently we must postulate a certain person who has this perceptual knowledge;  \nand that person must also be the one who created the Veda at the beginning.\n22\\. If one contends that such entities as mountains, earth and the like are not effects,  \nthe \"answer is as follows:\n[[18]]  \nThe entities in question, earth etc., are effects,  \nbecause they have a complex construction, like a king's palace (cf. Udayana, Kusumanjali 4.1.).  \nSimilarly, from the fact that they are made up of parts  \nwe conclude that they are subject to destruction.\nEntities that can be destroyed are destroyed by someone who knows the means by which they can be destroyed,  \njust as we can destroy clay vessels etc.  \nwhen we know by what means to destroy them.\nIn the case of entities that are shattered, for instance, by a falling tree,  \nthat is without perceptible intelligent agency,  \nthe cause of their destruction remains dubious:  \nbut because of this very dubiety  \nthere can also be not positive certainty that the cause of their destruction is entirely occasional.\nMotion, when there is mass, is sufficient ground to infer in this world  \nthat an entity which has mass and can move is subject to origination and to destruction.\nIt being thus established that earth etc. are indeed effects, on the grounds adduced above,  \nit follows that the Bhagavan has knowledge of dharma and adharma  \nwhich are the instrumental causes of origination and annihilation.\nConsequently, the entities here in question, earth, mountains and the like,  \nhave been created by a maker who possesses the described knowledge.\nEverything that has origin and end is, in our experience, created by such a maker,  \njust because it is subject to origination and annihilation, like a house.\n[[19]]  \n23\\. Let it not be argued that  \n\n> there is no intermediate production of effects like body, world etc.  \nbetween acts that bring about the desires of the person who undertakes them,\nfor these acts are unable to produce anything \nunless they are used as an instrument by a spiritual being,  \nsince they are non-spiritual themselves, like an adze:\nwithout the operation of a spiritual being-- the carpenter-  \nan adze is incapable of effecting by itself such objects as a sacrificial pole,\nAnd we are not able to create through the instrumentality of apurva factors:  \nfor before the actual fruition of the ritual act we cannot know their instrumentality,\nand it has been said that only a person who has actual knowledge of the material and instrumental causes  \ncan be a maker with respect to these causes.\nAnd there is no embodied soul which is known, or claimed, to be capable of having the required actual knowledge of the apurva that is to arise from the act.\nTherefore we must admit a Person of absolute omnipotence \nwho is able to take in at a glance the entire Universe with dharma and adharma of all embodied souls, their experiencing of karmic results etc.,  \nand in whose nature such properties as unrestricted knowledge etc. subsist.\nAs they say (unidentified source): \n\"The unobstructed knowledge, perfect impartiality, omnipotence of a universal lord and dharma are all four established together.\"\nMantras, arthavadas, epic and purana corroborate this point; e.g.\n\"The one god, Prajapati, creating heaven and earth, created the Vedas,\" etc. (RV. 10. 90. 14)\nAt the moment of inception  \nthe great Grace of this Person who is the Bhagavan  \nis evoked by a glance at the aggregate of individual souls  \nwho are almost in a state of non-spiritual stupor,   \ntheir instruments for the experiencing of karmic results- body, senses and other organs-being completely dissolved.\n[[20]]  \nHis Grace evoked, he originates the entire universe  \nand simultaneously He creates the triple Veda  \nwhich states pellucidly the means  \nby which the souls in transmigration can realize the objects of their desires.\nThen again, perceiving that they are in a pitiable condition,  \nbeing immersed in the ocean of existence  \nwhich is perturbed by wave upon wave of all manner of iniquities,\nHis heart burns with supreme compassion  \nand He promulgates, through Sanatkumara, Narada etc., the Pancarãtra Samhitās  \nwhich constitute the sources of knowledge  \nabout the manner in which He should be propitiated to attain to perfect bliss.\nForasmuch as the Tantras are therefore based upon an immediate cognition of the Lord  \nand are consequently self-sufficient like the Vedas,  \ncan they belong in the company of any Tradition, that of Manu or anyone?\nREFUTATION.   \n24\\. If this is true, then on what authority is such a creator of the Vedas known to exist?  \nHe is not directly perceived.\nNor can we infer from the fact that the Veda is word  \nthat it therefore must have an author,  \nfor that would entail the total reversion of your special contentions.\nFor an utterance that is perceived to depend for its composition on the agency of some being  \nis also perceived to be uttered by no one but an embodied being …\n[[21]]  \nwhose happiness and unhappiness resulted from his good and evil karman,  \nand who therefore cannot be God.\nMoreover, in that case it would be impossible  \nto establish the authority of the Vedas themselves;  \nfor if dharma-the Law-is not independent of other means of knowledge,  \nthere is no exclusive authority of the Vedas.\n25\\. OBJECTION.  \nBut why should dharma be independent of other means of knowledge?  \nFor we have asserted that  \n\n> He has actual knowledge of dharma and adharma:  \nhow else could He produce the world of which dharma and adharma are the instrumental causes?\nREPLY.  \nThat has indeed been asserted,  \nbut the assertion is fallacious:  \nfor no creator of the entire universe can be found  \nof whom this can be assumed.\nTo your argument that the world must be effected  \nbecause it has a complex construction  \ncan be objected that empiricists distinguish three kinds of entities:\nThose whose makers are evident to perception, e.g. pots and the like;  \nthose which are not found to be made at all (the individual soul) +++(eg. sky)+++;  \nand those whose creation remained doubtful, like the earth etc.\nIn the two first-mentioned cases  \nthere is no room for God's activity.\nAs to the third, the earth etc. are not involved in a total origination or disintegrations,  \nbut merely, as now, subject to varying degrees of increase and decrease which are adventitious.\nTo say that the Mimāmsakas accept origination and annihilation in this sense is to prove the proved.\n[[22]]  \nIn our opinion, too,  \nthese intelligent agents bring about various results  \nby means of sacrifices and other acts,  \nin order to enjoy these results themselves;  \nand the assumption that they are indeed,  \nas is proved for both of us, instrumental therein is quite correct,  \nfor we can have direct knowledge of these acts, sacrifices, donations and the like.\nHowever, the special power described with terms like apurva \ncan never be open to perception.  \nHow then can we have use for a supervising God?\n26\\. Certainly, it is not true that an agent, for instance a potter,  \nwhen he wishes to produce a certain product- pots-  \nmust first have direct knowledge of the power of their material cause- clay- and instrumental cause- stick- to produce these products  \nbefore he can actually undertake their production.\nElse people who are unaware of the power of the requisite causes  \nwould never be able to employ these causes in order to produce the results they want.  \nIn the case under discussion the persons concerned do indeed know  \nwhich causes are required to bring about the results they want, for they know these causes, such as sacrifices etc.,  \nthrough the knowledge they have obtained from eternal Scripture.  \nThus, aided by these causes, they render manifest such products as earth etc.\nAlso, there is no invariable rule  \nthat only an agent to whom the material and instrumental causes are fully known  \nis capable of undertaking an action  \nand nobody else.\nA man can still be an agent in the action of knowing  \nwithout perceiving in his own mind the material and instrumental causes  \nthat go into the making of this action of knowing.  \nWhy, then, contend that the causes must be known first?  \n27\\. The contention that the entire Universe is subject to annihilation  \nbecause it has parts is incorrect.\nSuch a conclusion is [[23]] cancelled by stronger perceptual evidence against it.\n\nFor the knowledge that does arise in the world of here and now is plainly this:  \n'Here is the meru; here is the sun; here is the earth.'\nRecognition conveys to us the knowledge that  \nthese entities are related to different times;  \nand certainly both in former and later ages  \nthere arise similar persons  \nwho have the same notion of these entities' present existence.\nTo put it in syllogistic form: \n\nThe past has persons who recognize earth, sun and mountain,  \nbecause the past is time, like the present.\nThe same syllogism can be constructed with regard to the future.\nThis reasoning does not entail the fallacious conclusion that pots etc. are eternal,  \nfor in their case origination and annihilation are directly evident.\nIt does not follow that,  \nwhen a certain fact cannot be proved on the strength of a certain ground,  \nsince this ground involves a contradiction,  \nthis same ground cannot prove the same fact  \nwhen it does not involve a contradiction.\nThe other inference that has been given to prove that the world is subject to origination and annihilation,  \nnamely on the ground of motion when there is mass,  \nis likewise incorrect;  \nfor this ground, too, is cancelled by the greater cogency of recognition.  \nConsequently, inference cannot provide positive proof  \nthat the world is subject to origination and annihilation.\n[[24]]  \n28\\. Further, you contend that there is a God, on the ground that the world is a product;  \nbut this ground precludes a specially qualified producer.  \nFor a product generally implies on the part of its producer  \na number of properties which are natural to him  \nand therefore indispensable for the precise knowledge of the concomitance between him and his product -  \nProperties like being in possession of a body,  \nhaving something left to desire,  \nbeing deprived of omnipotence and omniscience, etc.\nHow, then, can the fact that the world is a product  \nconvey to us the knowledge that the producer proposed for it  \npossesses the postulated properties, of being bodiless, eternally satisfied, omniscient etc., properties,  \nthat is, which are the opposite of what would naturally follow?\nThe production of a product requires the activation of the body,  \nwhich requires on the producer's part an effort  \nwhose inherent cause is his relation with a body \nand is impossible of any but just such a producer. \nIt follows that under no condition bodiless person can be an agent.\nOr if, in order to remove this fault from the argument,  \nit is assumed that the producer indeed possesses a body,  \nthen the question arises,  \nIs that body itself subject to origination or not?  \nIf it be subject to origination,  \nthere is infinite regress.  \nIf it be eternal, then your contention that  \nwhatever has parts must come to an end is not universally true.\nThe solution of others, namely that God's special properties can be demonstrated by an ad-hoc conclusion, does not hold good either.\nFor that rule holds only of a case where  \na conflict follows from a means of knowledge  \nbut does not actually exist.  \nIn our case, however, the conflict is plain enough.\n[[25]]  \n29\\. OBJECTION. But if even a well-considered invariable concomitance cannot demonstrate that the cause of the earth etc. is an intelligent being,  \nthen all logical process of deduction is done with.  \nBut if deduction can indeed convey true knowledge,  \nthat it must also convey that there is a producer capable of creating the entire universe.\nREPLY. We do not say  \nthat your deduction fails to demonstrate that there is such a producer,  \nbut that it also demonstrates without discrimination as many properties in this producer  \nas at the moment of grasping the concomitance, are known to obtain in any producer.\nNor do we carry our point too far.\nIn a case where the term  \nwhich we seek to establish through deduction  \ncan also be known through another means of knowledge,  \nthen this other means of knowledge may exclude from our term certain contrary properties  \nwhich would have applied on the strength of our inferential mark alone.\nIn the present instance, however, we are seeking to demonstrate God whose agency falls completely outside the scope of other means of knowledge;  \nin his case therefore all the properties that participate in an invariable concomitance  \nelicited through positive and negative consideration  \nare indiscriminately established by the deduction,\nA similarly occasional relationship between producer and product occurs,  \nfor instance, with grass that has grown just outside a house-garden.  \nWe cannot be positive that this grass has sprung from a person's action.  \nIn this instance, too, the assumption that a person, beyond the ken of our senses, has in fact been instrumental to the creation etc. of the world   \nmust remain entirely conjectural,\n[[26]] \n \n30\\. Another question to be considered is  \nfrom what point in space,  \nat what point in time,  \nand to what purpose  \na person who is satisfied in all eternity would produce the universe.  \nEvery agent, e.g., a potter, produces a product  \nby means of certain instruments,  \nwhile occupying a certain space at a certain time  \nand aiming at a certain result which he wants.\nIf the production of the world is purely sport and without ulterior motivation,  \nsince God does not want anything, beware,  \nfor this states clearly that the Lord is by nature independent from anything beside Himself.  \nYet willynilly, without regard for anything He might wish, He shoulders the vast task of creating, sustaining and destroying the world.\nIs He in creating the creatures prompted by His compassion?  \nBut why, then, does He not create them happy?  \nIf you reply, because God takes karman into account,  \nthen you deny his complete independence.  \nBesides, if their karman provides sufficient causes for these creatures' variety,  \nwhy assume God at all?\nTherefore, there cannot be such a person  \nwho is capable of creating the universe,  \nof perceiving immediately dharma and adharma,  \nand of composing the Vedas.\n31\\. Moreover, if the Vedas were created by someone,  \nthis creator would be remembered:  \n'He is the one who has composed them.\"\nIt is not proper to assume  \nthat he has been forgotten,  \njust as the digger of an exhausted well is forgotten.  \nThe latter is justifiable  \nbecause the well no longer serves a purpose.\nBut in the case of the Vedas, who,  \nwithout remembering that the author was reliable,  \nwould give credence to all the Vedic rites  \nwhich are to be performed at the expense of great trouble  \ninvolving the loss of various properties?\nConsequently, if it cannot be proved of the Vedas  \nthat they have been composed by a person,  \nbecause this person, however worthy of remembrance, is not remembered,  \nthey can no more prove that God was their author  \nthan the Mahabharata and similar books can.\nTherefore the Vedas do not originate from a person.\nIn consequence, the contention that the validity of Pañcaratra is based upon the same immediate cognition  \nwhich is the basis of the validity of the Veda itself  \nis the contention of those whose discrimination  \nhas been warped by their bias in favour of their own conclusions.\n32\\. OBJECTION. But in what does this 'preterpersonal' character of the Veda consist?  \nIf it consists in this that the Vedas are composed of eternal words,  \nthe same holds true of the Pañicarātra Tantra.\nOr if it is the eternity of the words that constitute it,  \nagain the same is true.\nIt could not be the eternity of the word-sequence,  \nfor sequence cannot be natural to eternal entities.\nIf it is said that it is the sequence of the sounds  \nin so far as these sounds are pronounced in one particular sequence,  \nthen we reply that since a sequence of pronunciation is non-eternal,  \nthe sequence of the sounds pronounced cannot be eternal.  \nSo where does the difference lie between Pañçaratra and Vedic revelation?\n[[28]]  \nREPLY.  \nThe difference lies herein that in the case of the Pañcaratra the sequence is created by an independent person,  \nwhereas in the case of the Veda,  \na dependent person invariably wishes to repeat the exact sequence  \nwhich had been laid down before him by students who preceded him.\nA category of a different degree  \nwhich is established on the strength of recognition  \nshould not be denied.  \nAnd with this we conclude our lengthy disquisition.\n33\\. The preceding has proved  \nthat the proposition that the Pañcaratra is authoritative  \nbecause it is based upon an immediate cognition of a person  \ncategorically different from other persons,  \nis not viable at all.\nSince there is no means of knowledge  \nby which the existence of a person who has immediate knowledge of good and evil can be proved,  \nit follows that this Tantra must have been promulgated  \nby some human being with the purpose of deceiving the world.\nnotes: A Naiyayika. Traditionally, Nyaya does not accept the Mimānsā view that the Vedas have not originated from a person.\nnotes: The argument is thus:  \nThe Veda is of personal origin, because it is language;  \nlanguage is invariably found to originate from persons.  \nThe Naiyayika compares the Mimasaka's view in the terms of this argument  \nwith the standard inference:  \nthe mountain has fire, because it has smoke.\nnotes: avatara \"descent, emergence.\" The meaning is as follows: Dharma is by definition that action which leads to a certain end by suprasensible law. Since the process (the Incans-end?? relation) is suprasensible, there can be no other authority for it than Scriptural authority.\nnotes: This envisages the world as the sum total of the fruits (phala) brought about by observance or non-observance of dharma, which is thus instrumental to world creation.\nnotes: Since they are products, they have been produced by a person (God) who knew the means by which to produce them (dharma and adharma).\nnotes: This is the Mimaṁsā view  \nwhich holds that the dharma and adharma as instruments in creation  \nare always the dharma and adharma of a particular intelligent being  \nwhose body is itself the product of dharma and adharma  \nand can therefore never, however intelligent he may be, control them.  \nThe Mimimsaka admits that the universe, being made up of parts, is subject to origination and destruction,  \nbut never at one time, since all entities presuppose former acts that have brought them about.\n\n[[127]]  \nThe law of dharma and adharma necessarily operates eternally.  \nNo agency is possible which can intervene in this eternal operation from act to act,  \nby either beginning or ending the universe.  \nOn this cf. Prakaraṇapañcikā, p. 137 ff. for the Prabhakara view, and Slokavārttika, Sambandhākṣepaparihāra 47-116 for the Bhitta view.[[127]]  \nThe law of dharma and adharma necessarily operates eternally.  \nNo agency is possible which can intervene in this eternal operation from act to act,  \nby either beginning or ending the universe.  \nOn this cf.

Tarkabhāṣā 43.\nnotes: It is the contention of Mimamsa that words and their capacity of conveying meaning are eternal.\nnotes: Sequence, of course, supposes priority and posteriority of the entities in sequence, while eternals are co-eternal.\nnotes: kramāvāntarajati; the difference resides in the createdness of the Pancarātra and the uncreatedness of the Veda, which introduces a difference of degree between the word sequences of both corpora of verbal statements."

This would be true if proof of the existence of the Lord  \ncould only be sought on the strength of logical argumentation.  \nAs it is, this is a fallacy,  \nfor the great Lord is known on the authority of the upaniṣads.\nWhen we hear the multitudinous statements of the eternal Scriptures  \nwhich set forth the existence of an omniscient and omnipotent supreme Personality  \nwho is capable of creating the entire universe,  \nhow then can we refuse to accept the authority of a tradition which derives from His immediate cognition?\n[[29]]  \n35\\. To continue this topic,  \nthese scriptural statements do not exceed the bounds of their authority  \njust because they are concerned with facts;  \nfor similar statements made by persons concerning facts that are extremely remote from a connection with other means of knowledge  \ncannot be denied the authority which is afforded them naturally.\nNor do statements concerning a fact lack authority  \nbecause of the consideration that since either a proving or disproving factor may unexpectedly turn up  \nthere remains the possibility that this fact is thus repeated or reversed;  \nfor the same may equally well happen to a statement concerning, not a fact, but a karya.\nA kārya, too, may be known from other means of knowledge,  \nfor it must be admitted that ordinary karyas, like 'fetch firewood'  \nare also known through other means of knowledge,  \nas in the case of the cooking of the odana.\nOr if it be claimed that,  \ninasmuch as a karya concerning a categorically different thing like the agnihotra etc. cannot conceivably find any other authority,  \ntherefore the verbal testimony which sets forth such a thing must needs be its authority,\nwell, then we may say that there is not a ghost of another authority for the Bhagavan  \nwhose form consists in unsurpassed knowledge, supremacy and beatitude;  \nso that it should follow that everything is entirely the same in both cases,  \ndepending on one's particular partisan views.\nMoreover, the theory is that since another means of knowledge can apply to a fact,  \na verbal statement concerning this fact cannot validly prove it:  \nbut why should not this other means of knowledge itself be the repetitious one  \nsince verbal testimony concerning its fact may conceivably turn up?\nor, why should other means of knowledge which themselves are liable to [[30]]various deficiencies  \nentail the negation of a notion that arises from eternal Scripture  \nuntouched by all defects inherent in persons,  \nmerely because it is deduced that its validity is cancelled by a prior means of knowledge?  \nThis is absurd.\nThus, therefore, the imperfections that necessarily follow from the induction, e.g. absence of omniscience\", possession of a body etc.,  \nfind no room in the Bhagavan whose supernal manifestation of miraculous knowledge, supremacy and so forth is known from hundreds of shrutis,  \njust as cold can find no place in fire.\nAnd, in consequence, \n\n> How can our tongue endeavour to state that the Tantra is false,  \nwhile it is composed by the Omniscient One Himself  \n> who is known through the Upanisads?\n> Alas for the fool's grand exhibition of labour in Mimāmsā!  \n> How can a mind schooled in Mimāmsā be so mistaken?\n36\\. Learned thinkers, whose intellectual powers command respect,  \nmaintain that all Vedic testimony carries authority  \nonly concerning such karyas as cannot presuppose any other authority.\nSince words are considered to have their true sense  \nonly when they concern such a karya,  \nit is impossible that any statement can be denotative  \nif it concerns something else than a karya.\nTherefore, when a man has observed that in an exchange between two adult persons  \na certain inherently related action of one of them takes place  \nimmediately upon his hearing a sentence uttered by the other,  \nhe concludes with certainty that the denoting power of the sentence as inferred by means of circumstantial-implication  \nterminates completely in the karya that has been conveyed by that sentence.\nThe very awareness of karya  \nis known to relate to one's own karya;  \nso the onlooker, observing the same process in the present case,  \nrealizes that the one person's action has been caused by the other person's variously differentiated behaviour. \n\n> \"Surely this person has been made aware by the other of this karya  \nthat he proceed to his action immediately upon become aware of what he has to do.\"\nThis leads the observer to the conclusion that \n if therefore the verbal statement is truly denotative  \nin so far as it serves to convey a karya  \nwhose specific motivation conforms to the entire statement,  \nthen whatever bits of meaning come to mind  \nas a result of the addition or omission of words  \nare denoted by these words  \nonly in strict accordance to this kārya, 71  \nwhich thus constitutes the primarily known principal element of the statement.\nIn such a statement the imperative and optative verbal terminations,  \nwhich unvaryingly give rise to a knowledge of karya,  \nconvey by themselves the body of the karya,  \nwhereas the indicative etc. terminations are subject to a contextual relation with the karya  \nby describing consequent matters which required by the karya, e.g. a person's qualification to accomplish it etc.\n37\\. Take for example the statement that a son has been born to the person spoken to,  \na purely substantive statement;  \nthe aggregate of words which convey nothing more than this bare fact  \nthat a son has been born,  \nis not definitely proved to possess the power [[32]] of denoting the postulated birth of the son  \nby means of such resultant effects as cheerful looks  \nor joyfully bristling hairs on the part of the father. \n\nFor, it is impossible to establish definitely  \nthat the occurrence of a cause for various joys in future, past and present  \nis really due to the denotative power of the statement.\nTherefore, also in the case  \nwhen we have a verb in the present indicative  \ncollocated with words that have their proper signification  \n(in that they refer to things that presuppose no other means of knowledge),  \nit must be assumed that  \nin it we have a substitute with a positive (i.e. injunctive) denotation of words  \nwithout actually having explicit reference to a kārya.\n38\\. A person knows that a certain word has a certain denotation,  \nwhen it is known what is the denotation, of the other words with which it is collocated.\nIt is proved that words have the power of denoting things  \nonly in so far as they are contextually connected with a karya;  \nconsequently, their validity concerning an established fact  \nis based on this that they give rise to the notion of karya.\nIt is contended that this denotation of karya is only occasional in words,  \nbut this contention is incorrect;  \nthe ground for words to be denotative  \nis that they deal with a karya,  \nso that the contention suffers of the vice of being unproved.\nFor a notion that arises from a verbal statement can never terminate in any object whatsoever that is not a karya.\n[[33]]  \nThe cognitions of contextual relations  \nwhich arise immediately upon hearing a profane statement  \nare said to derive, not from Verbal Testimony, but from Inference. 78  \nThus it is right that these cognitions do not terminate in karyas.\nE.g., a statement \"there are fruits on the river bank\"  \ndoes not by itself, self-sufficiently, create in the hearer  \nthe knowledge that there are fruits on the river bank;  \nthe means of knowledge here really is inference, since the hearer must infer  \nthat the speaker knows what he is talking about,  \nthat he knows that fruit means \"fruit\",  \nriver bank 'river bank,\" etc.\n39\\. If it were not accepted that verbal statements always bear on karyas,  \non what grounds then could an indicative statement like agnihotram juhoti  \n\"he offers the agnihotra\"  \nbe accepted as an injunction?\nOr if it be claimed that in this case, even though the statement as it stands has no complete validity,  \nit is accepted as an injunction in order to ensure that it subserves a purpose,\nwe reply that this claim is incorrect,  \nsince the operation of means of knowledge  \nis not dependent on purpose,  \nbut rather is the acceptance of purpose  \ndependent on the operation of the means of knowledge.\nIt is not proper to assume that  \nsince one does not like to find rocks  \nwhen one is looking for gold  \ntherefore one finds gold!\nAs long as we do not assume that a statement is denotative  \nonly when it bears on a karya,  \nwe cannot assume that a verb in the present indicative  \ncontains an injunction.+++(5)+++\n40\\. In the same manner  \nthe meaning of the upaniṣads must also be interpreted  \nas being subordinate to such injunctions as  \n\"One must know the soul, meditate on it, etc.\"  \nwhich are expressed in differnt passages;  \nthis meaning, then, is that  \none must know the omniscient soul which is beatitude, i.e. an injunction.\nThat the soul is the object of an injunction  \ndoes not by itself however prove  \nthat the soul exists as an established fact;  \nfor there can also be an injunction that  \na certain thing be such while actually it is not so;\nfor example the injunction, \"Know your father in someone who is not your father,\"  \nor \"Know that the[[34]] syllable OM, which is not the udgitha, is the udgitha.\" (Ch Up. 1.5.1. [[132]])\nAll statements that set forth the reality and the eternality of the soul  \nonly serve to convey that there is a spiritual agent,  \nwho is required in order to experience the otherworldly fruits  \nthat are mentioned in ritual injunctions  \nwhere the time of fruition is not specified.\nTherefore, no verbal statement whatever is a means of knowing a thing as such.\nThus, by denying that the arthavādas, too,  \ncan serve to convey knowledge of facts like Rudra's weeping,  \nit is shown that they merely serve to give praise in contextual connection with an injunction,  \nwhich may be comparatively remote.\n41\\. To conclude, it follows that the postulated divine person,  \nwhose personality is the product of the baseless beliefs of people  \nthat have failed to consider the true denotation of preceding or succeeding statements,  \nis eliminated,  \nwith which we conclude our extensive discussion.\n42\\. It is proved now that the pre-eminence of that postulated person cannot be borne out by Scripture.\nLet us, further, suppose that Scripture can indeed convey knowledge of facts;\neven so, what possible basis is there  \nfor the assumption that there exists a person  \nwho knows dharma and adharma,  \nwhen we take into account the cognition that arises from injunction?\nOmniscience is possible  \nonly if the omniscient person knows the objects  \nexactly as they are known by means of the different means of knowledge;\nfor there is no statement which declares omniscience  \nby cancelling the normal means of knowledge.\n[[35]]  \nEven if there were such a statement,  \nit would have to be explained as an arthavada  \nsince its word-meanings would not allow of mutual relation.\nA cognition about a sentence-meaning arises from the individual words  \nand it presupposes in these words  \nsuch properties as appropriateness etc.  \nwhich are learnt through other means of knowledge;  \nnow we wonder how such a cognition could arise at all,  \nif there were a conflict with these other means of knowledge  \nthat are required primarily for the cognition to arise!\nIf a statement concerning an object that is contradicted by perception etc., were authoritative,  \nwho could then reject the identity of sun and sacrificial pole? +++(5)+++\nnotes: This is Yamuna's objection, which states the extent to which he concurs in the preceding Mimāmsā argument against Nyaya.\nnotes: This starts the discussion of the Prabhakara theory on the limitations of the validity of verbal statements.  \nFirst general Mimāmsā views on the subject are discussed.\nnotes: The validity of shabda lies in its communicating contents that cannot be known through other means of knowledge.  \nWhat I translate as 'facts' are more literally \"established [[129]] entities,\" established, that is, by other means of knowledge than shabda.  \nA scriptural statement of the kind \"grass is green\" is not strictly valid  \nin the sense that, in order to know that grass is green, we need a scriptural statement to that effect.\n\nAnother proving factor, c.g., the means of knowledge Perception, may turn up conceivably  \nand thus make the scriptural statement superfluous;  \nor we may find that grass is not invariably green, but changes its colour,  \nwhich would reverse the scriptural statement.\n\nScriptural validity, i.e., Scripture's being a means of knowledge, is to the Prabhakara Mimimsaka, its being the sole means of knowing a particular thing.  \nTo the Prabhakara this validity is ideal in the case of injunctions concerning actions which, suprasensibly, lead to a certain desired end.\nnotes: (The injunction concerning the odana oblation includes an injunction concerning the preparation of the odana and the fetching of firewood for the cooking. Since experience shows that for a cooking fire one needs firewood, this karya is not strictly known on scriptural authority.)\nnotes: This objection ignores the priorities among pramanas, or means of knowledge;  \nfor the Prabhakara, Perception, etc. are prior to, take precedence of, Scripture in case of perceptible, etc. contents.  \nGenerally Perception is prior to Inference.  \nTo Yamuna, therefore, no priority of Perception to Scripture is given,  \nwhich is expected since in his view Scripture may also be an account of (God's) Perception,  \nas in the case of Pancaratra.\nnotes: This sums up the conclusion of the refutations of both the Naiyayika's and Mimamsaka's views:  \nthe defects consequent upon the Nyaya proofs of God are avoided  \non the basis of scriptural examination,  \nsince Scripture can indeed validly pronounce on God.\nnotes: The Prabhakaras, who are notorious for the gaurava 'complicatedness\" of their argumentations.+++(5)+++\nnotes: \"Denotation, denoting power, denotativeness\" in the following Prabhakara discussions  \nhave to be understood as the power of verbal statements to provide unprecedented and non-superfluous knowledge  \nconcerning their contents.  \nIn the Prabhakara view, a verbal statement by itself is denotative only in injunctive forms,  \nwhile substantive statements have denotation either through contextual connection with injunctive statements,  \nor (but this is not strictly \"true\" denotation) through repetition of otherwise knowable facts.  \nThis view, which has obviously been developed for scriptural statements in the first place,  \nis thereupon extended to ordinary language as well,  \nand is thus expressed in the following theory about learning language which is here understood.  \nA child learns what certain sentences 'mean'  \nby observing the action which his elders take upon hearing these sentences,  \nWhen he knows no language meaning (vyutpatti),  \nhe may acquire knowledge by first hearing one adult tell another to \"get the cow,\"  \nand subsequently observing that the other is getting the cow:  \nby associating the two events he knows that an order to get the cow  \nwas the content of the first adult's statement \"get the cow.\"  \nA remark without consequent action (e.g., \"It is hot today,\")  \ncannot convey any such knowledge to one who does not know language.  \nThe process of the child knowing the sentence meaning  \nis here described as arthapatti \"reasoning by circumstantial implication;\"  \nsince there is no other ground for the second man's getting the cow,  \nit must have been the first man's statement.\nnotes: [[130]]  \nThus śalikanatha, Prakaranapancika, p. 182: niyo?? yali?? sarvakarye yaft soakiyalvena?? budhyate.\nnotes: That is to say that the denotativeness of the words composing the statement  \nis dependent upon the injunctive denotation of the statement as a whole.\nnotes: The linādi verbal terminations of Sanskrit to which in English correspond verbs compounded with auxiliaries like \"should, must, to be to, ought to.\" \n\n[[131]]\n\nFor example, a sentence:  \n\"He desires to go to heaven,\"  \nwhich has the verb in the indicative,  \nfollowed by a statement  \n\"he should sacrifice with a soma sacrifice,\"  \nwhere the verb is injunctive,  \nis truly denotative in spite of its indicative form,  \nsince it is obviously subordinated to the injunctive sentence,  \nto which it describes the performer's qualification:  \nonly one who desires to go to heaven has title to, is qualified for, the performance of a soma sacrifice.\nnotes: This is an example like \"it is hot today;\" the young father's happy countenance is not considered an action,\nnotes: E.g., the sentence \"he who desires to go to heaven offers the soma sacrifice,\" is an injunctive statement in indicative form.\nnotes: This is the Prabhakara view of the denotativeness of single words,  \nsummarized in the formula anvitābhidhāna, which is short for kāryānvitābhidhana \"denotation of words syntactically connected in an injunctive sentence,\"\nnotes: This point will be taken up and confirmed infra §04.\nnotes: This is again the Prabhakara view. The Bhatta view is somewhat different;  \naccording to the latter the upanisads are arthavadas (subsidiary substantive statements laudatory of elements of injunctions) to the eternality of the performer's personality (atman),+++(5)+++  \nwhich eternality is presupposed by the efficacy of the injunction:  \ne.g., the injunction \"he who desires heaven must offer with the soma sacrifice\"  \nsupposes the immortality of the performer.\nnotes: In this the Prabhakara concurs with the Bhatta. Injunctions without time of fruition specified are not guaranteed to bring about the desired effect during the present lifetime of the performer.\nnotes: I read ata avarthavādānām.\n\nOn this point see KMS 1.2.1. with Sabara's bhāṣya.\nnotes: On the Bhatta view of omniscience, cf. Kumārila, Samb. 47-59; 114-116.\nnotes: i.e, the appropriateness or propriety of a word in collocation with other words; in the sentence \"his mother is barren,\" \"barren\" is obviously inappropriate.\nnotes: The identification is considered an arthavada, i,e., laudatory of the sacrificial pole"

OBJECTION. However, those who follow the Pancaratra clan have the tradition that this Pañcaratra has been composed by this person.\nREFUTATION. But why do the Pasupatas then not agree with their view?  \nThey, too, claim that the Sovereign of the universe is the promulgator of their own system,  \nand others have the same claims.\nNow they cannot all of them be omniscient,  \nbecause then it would be impossible for them to set forth mutually contradictory teachings.\nThe same ground which allows one among several discussants to prove an omniscient promulgator  \nmust hold equally for all of them.  \nBut which one among the many omniscient beings  \nwho propound mutually conflicting teachings  \nwhile claiming each for himself the prerogative of omniscience,  \nwhich one do we conclude is the one and only omniscient God?\n[[36]]  \nAs the (unidentified) text says,  \n\n> \"If there are several omniscient beings who propound incompatible doctrines  \n> and if for each of them the arguments are equally valid,  \n> then whom can we elicit as the true and only one ?\"\nWhen each omniscient being is assumed on the basis of one's own Tantra doctrine  \nsince the various tantric doctrines are mutually in conflict,  \nthe result will be that none of them is authoritative, !\n44\\. OBJECTION.  \nHow can the teaching of Vasudeva himself,  \nwho is well-known in Revelation and Tradition,  \nbe brought to the same level as other Tantras?\nFor the manifestation of His power has been revealed in the Purusa Hymn (RV. 10.90 14),  \n\"The earth sprang from his feet,  \nthe quarters of the sky from his ears;\"  \nand again,   \n\"The creator created sun and moon as before;\"   \nlikewise, \"He is Brahma, he is śiva;\" (Mahānār Up 11.12.)  \n\"Visnu's highest step\" (Kath Up. 3.9.)\n> No one is his lord in this world, no one his commander; he has no sign. (Svet Up. 6.9.)\n\nIn this way, the statements of Revelation describe his manifestation  \ncharacterized by His origination, maintenance and annihilation of the world.\nSimilarly, the Tradition: \n\n> \"From Visnu arose the world, in him does it subsist;  \n> he is the one who causes it to exist and to perish,\"  \n> (Visnu Pur. 1.1.31.)\n\nsaid Parāśara;\nManu, too, declared that He is the lord: \n\n> \"Nārāyaṇa is above the unmanifest, and the World-egg is produced by the unmanifest.\"93\nThis Supreme Person  \nwho is continually praised for His knowledge and supremacy in the statements of Revelation and of the sages  \nhas created Pañcaratra.  \nIf this Tantra is then on a level with Tantras that are apostate from the path of Revelation,  \nthen one might as well reason that a soma-drinker is on a level with a ~~wine~~beer-drinker,  \njust because he is a drinker!\n[[37]]\n\nIs this Tantra not superior?  \nWherefore, then, are the qualities of immaculate knowledge, supremacy etc. of the Bhagavan  \nnot currently attributed also to the Destroyer of the Three Cities in the texts of Revelation?  \nTherefore it is absurd to hold the equality of the Tantras promulgated by both.  \nOr, since He is the God who is the cause of the origination, protection and destruction of the universe  \nand for whom the entire Vedanta furnishes evidence to the exclusion of anyone else,  \nhow could He promulgate a doctrine that is outside the pale of the Veda?\n45\\. OBJECTION.  \nNevertheless, a fair number of śrutis are found  \nwhich ascribe omniscience and omnipotence to lord Pasupati as well:  \n\n\"He who is allknowing, omniscient;\" (Mund Up. 1.1.9.)\n\n\"The supreme great sovereign of sovereigns.\" (Svet Up. 6.7.)\nREPLY. By secondary denotation  \nthese two words \"omniscient\" and \"sovereign\" apply  \nnot only to the one who actually is omniscient and sovereign,  \nbut also to others, not excepting God Siva,  \nwho are as it were all-knowing and supreme.\nBesides, if in the above quotation \"ya sarvajnah sarvavit\"  \nthe word sarvajiia were indeed used to describe the omniscient one,  \nthere would be tautology of sarvavit. \n\nConsequently, the word sarvajia refers only to Mahadeva;\nand so the Skanda-Purana, Linga-Purāņa and other Purāņas exhaust themselves  \nin describing this all knowing and sovereign character of Siva.\n[[38]]  \nTherefore, since the Pasupata Tantra has been promulgated by this Pasupati,  \nit acquires authority in this way;  \nbut the reversion of the authority of all Tantras in consequence of their mutual contradictions  \napplies to this Pasupata Tantra too.\n46\\. Further, granted that the Lord Vasudeva is the Person known in the upaniṣads,  \nhow then can the theory be held of him that he has promulgated the Pañcarātra Tantra  \nwhich conflicts with Revelation of him who said, \"Revelation and Tradition are my commands ?'' (unidentified)\nThus we conclude that there has been a deceiver  \nwho assumed the name of 'Vasudeva'  \nand under that name composed the Tantra under \ndiscussion.\nOr else, suppose that Vasudeva Himself, ruler of the entire universe, was the promulgator of this Tantra; they still say that\nHari, whose personal manifestations are deceptive  \nbecause of his power of illusion,  \nhas promulgated these unholy texts deceivingly  \nunder the guise of holy texts  \nin order to destroy the whole mass of enemies of the gods.  \nNow, has he indeed composed this Tantra,  \nleading the faithful into the mysterious abyss of his grand power of illusion, or not?  \nThis is the question that now arises.  \nHow are we to resolve it?\nOr are we rather to understand that  \nhe composed this Tantra  \nwhile he himself was in error,  \nsince it is not accepted by the followers of the Veda,  \njust as the doctrine of the Jainas is not accepted?\nThat the followers of the Veda do not accept it has been set forth at length above.100   \nConsequently, then,  Pancaratra Tantra is not authoritative  \nbecause it derives from the cognition of an independent Person.\n47\\. Nor is it proper to argue the validity of the Pancaratra Tradition \"like the Manu Tradition etc. 101\n[[39]]   \nIf the God has composed the Tantra after having, like manu etc., learnt the meaning of the Veda from a teacher who was satisfied with his pupil's obedience,  \nthen the assumption that He was independent is purposeless and false.\nIt is not borne out by human experience that the Veda was immediately manifest to him, even though he never learnt it. The defects \nwhich the Author of the Varttika enumerates, those of personal superiority and inferiority etc., (Kumarila, Slokavārttika 2.114)  \nare all to be presumed in the case of Pañcarātra,\nnotes: The relation between God and the texts has to be proved. \nI read yadi ca for api ca.\nnotes: Not in Manusmrti; reference perhaps to Manu 1.9-10? \nI read tatha pi.\nnotes: supra § 12.\nnotes: supra §11."

Furthermore, that a doctrine destitute of all logic  \nand embracing the view that the soul knows birth,  \nwhich is rejected by Revelation and Tradition,  \nshould be Truth is a highly ludicrous contention.\nThus we find the śruti,  \n \n> \"Verily, this soul is unperishing, essentially indestructible;  \n> it is not conjoined with sizes\" (BA Up. 4.5.14.)\n\nand, \n\n> \"This dies without the soul; the soul does not die.\"\\*104 (Ch Up. 6.11.3.)\nOBJECTION.  \nThis is all very well,  \nbut all that this statement says is that the soul is not destroyed,  \nnot that it is not born.\nREFUTATION. No, by stating that it cannot be destroyed,  \nit also decides that it cannot be born;  \nit is impossible that an entity that has been born  \ndoes not perish.\nOBJECTION.  \nNonetheless, from the emphasis which in the statement \"only sat was here\" (ChUp.6.2.1.) is laid on the uniqueness of sat,  \nit follows that there were no souls before the time of creation.\nHad the individual soul existed before  \nwhy then this emphasis of \"only sat\"  \non sat's absolute solitariness?\n[[40]]  \nREFUTATION.  \nThe reply to this is that  \nhere the emphasis on sat's uniqueness  \nis with regard to the elements of wind, water and ether  \nthat were about to be created by sat.\nWere the soul excluded by this statement of sat's solitariness,  \nthen the soul's origin would have been described in the sequel,  \njust as the creation of ether is described.\nThis is not done; therefore the soul does not know birth,  \nsince in the sequel \"That sat created fire, etc. (Ch Up. 6.2.3. )  \nwe do not hear of the creation of the individual soul.\nOBJECTION. However, in the text yato va imani bhūtāni etc.  \nwe hear that the souls too know origin, continuance and reabsorption.\nHere the word bhuta denotes the jiva, the individual soul;  \nfor thus we find the word used in the passage bhrāmayan sarvabhūtāni,\nThe verb jianti \"they live\" in the text can only apply to the souls,  \nthe expression tena jayante \"by whom they are born\" evidently refers to these same souls.\n[[41]]\nREFUTATION. This is not right.  \nThe word bhuta commonly deonly the elements ether, wind, fire, water and earth.  \nIf the word is used for something else, it is used metaphorically.\nOf these elements, ether etc. which are primarily understood by the word bhuta,  \nit is stated that they are variously modified and that they live.\nThe verb \"they live\" describes a condition of being analogous to living.  \nAnd if the word bhuta be used in the sense of individual soul,  \nthen too the statement declares that the soul is born only in the sense that its entrance into a body is a birth.\nTherefore, when the word bhuta refers to the individual soul,  \nit can rightly be said that the souls are born,  \njust as it is said that the cow,  \nonce born walks about.\nThere are śrutis to this effect, like  \n\"For the soul, unborn, alone\" (Svet Up. 4.5.)  \nand we also have other Śrutis which declare that the soul is unborn.  \nSimilarly, the word of the Lord:\n\"Know that both matter and spirit are without beginning;\"  (Bh G. 13.19.)\n\"this ancient spirit is unborn, eternal, everlasting;\" (Kath Up. 2.18.)\n\"it is never born nor does it die\" etc. (Kath Up. 2.17.)\nFinally there is the syllogism:  \nthe individual soul in question never knows birth; \nfor, while being substantial, it is bodiless,  \nas it consists of spirit, like the Supreme Soul.\nnotes: Taitt Up. 3.1.1. \nThe whole sentence includes tena jivanti, on which the present exegesis of bhuta is based.\nnotes: namely, that they are born (jātāri) and die (prayanti)."

We reply, What is this nonauthoritativeness which this reasoning seeks to prove?\n[[44]] \n\nIf it is defined by the fact that the Tantra does not produce knowledge,  \nthen this definition militates against Perception;  \nfor the knowledge which arises in a student, who is able to comprehend the relation between word and meaning, concerning the meaning of the sentences of Pañcaratra Sastra  \nhe hears is perceptually evident.\nNor is the predicate, sc. \"nonauthoritativeness,\" defined by dubiety,  \nsince then we have the same conflict with Perception;  \nfor the statement, \"One must worship the four-armed Supreme Person in the centre of the lotus,\"  \ndoes not occasion a doubtful cognition:  \n\"Must one worship Him thus or not?\"\nNor, in the third place, is the predicate, defined by reversion,  \nsince there is no non-apprehension of what should be there,  \nand since, the presumption of future reversion militates against Perception  \nand would put an end to all operations.  \nThis point shall be discussed in detail later on.\n56\\. ~~Still, the proposed validity of Pañcarātra militates against Scripture. Since in Pañcarātra Agama we have its meaning conveyed exactly as it is, this conflict between Scripture and Pañcarātra is not vicious only if Pañcaratra is not authoritative.~~\nREFUTATION.  \nWhy, if that were so, that would mean that  \n~~if its authority is disproved by Scripture  \nit is proved by Inference,  \nand if it is proved by inference  \nit is disproved by Scripture;  \nwhich is a vicious circle.~~\n57\\. Besides, what does this mean, \"being nonVedic, or outside the Veda?\"\n[[45]]  \nIf it means that Pañcaratra is different from the Veda,  \nwe have an occasional application to Perception etc.,  \nwhich are also different from the Veda.\nIf, in order to avoid this defect, the ground is thus specified, 'because, while being language, it is different from the Veda,' we have a hetvantaram deadlock,  \nwhich, as they say, occurs when into a syllogism with an unqualified ground  \nand additional qualification is accepted 120\nAlso, we then have an occasional application to the statements of Manu, \nwhich also are language and different from the Veda,\nIf then, my slow-witted opponent, in order to remove this defect from your ground  \nyou claim that being outside the Veda means  \n\"not deriving from the Veda,\"  \nthen what do you, logician, think of it?\nWell, by this definition of the ground we get meaning,  \n\n> \"something, namely in case there is question of language-statements, is non-Vedic,  \n> because it does not derive from the Veda.\" \n\nBut then there is an occasional application to the Veda itself,  \nwhich does not derive from the Veda!\nWhen the ground is redefined as \n\n> \"because it does not derive from the Veda,  \n> in case of a language-statement but not a Vedic statement,\"\nthen again there would inevitably be an occasional application to statements of reliable persons  \nwhich do not derive from the Veda  \nand yet are valid, like  \n\"There are trees on the river-bank.\"\nIf the reason is further corrected into:  \n\"because it does not derive from the Veda, namely, in case of a language-statement -but not a Vedic statement-  \nand this statement concerns an action to be taken,\"  \nthen still we have a vicious applicability to such precepts as  \n\"One must eat little when one has indigestion.\"\n[[46]]  \nAgain, if the ground is then reformulated as \n\n> \"because it does not derive from the Veda, in case of a statement specified by all the above specifications  \n> and also concerned with dharma and adharma,\"  \n\nthen this ground is partly impertinent, because Pancarātra Sastra does not deal with dharma and adharma exclusively,  \nsince the great majority of its Statements concern Brahman.\nIf then, the specification is added  \n\"....when it deals with objects that are outside the scope of other pramāņas,\"  \nthen again the ground does not fully apply,  \nfor hundreds of śrutis demonstrate  \nthat the Perception of God encompasses all things related to dharma and adharma.\nWe shall discuss this point presently (infra §§ 76 F.);  \nthis suffices for the time being to expose the baseless fancies  \nof those who have not made a study of Akṣapada's system.\nOther conceivable inferences will be presented; and refuted, later on.  \nWe conclude therefore, that the proposition \"Pañcarātra is authoritative,\" is not in conflict with Inference.\n58\\. Nor is it in conflict with Scripture,  \nfor hundreds of scriptural statements, like idam mahopaniṣadam,  \nwill be adduced which set forth that Pañcarātra is authoritative.\nThere are no grounds to suspect in our proposition  \nanyone of the three kinds of contradiction of language-statements;  \nnamely, contradiction within the terms of the statement;  \ncontradiction with one's own thesis;  \nor contradiction with universally accepted facts.\n[[47]]  \nFirst, there is no contradiction within the statement.  \nThis type of contradiction is of three kinds of mere utterance;  \nor utterance of property;  \nand of utterance of substance.\nFirstly, the proposition is not contradicted by its mere utterance,  \nfor the statement of the thesis \"Pañcarātra Sastra is authoritative\"  \ndoes not cancel its own content, as does, for instance, the statement:  \n\"During my entire life I have kept silence.\"\nSecondly, there is no contradiction through utterance of property,  \nas for example the statement: \"All statements are untrue;\"  \nfor the authoritativeness predicated of Pañcarātra  \ndoes not cancel the proposition.\nThirdly, there is no contradiction through utterance of substance,  \nsince in the given substance a connection with the given property is not contradictory:  \nPancarātra is not contradicted by its property authoritativeness,  \nas motherhood is contradicted by the property sterility.\nFor upon the assertion of the authoritativeness of the substance in question,  \nit is not contradicted by any particular substance named in Revelation,  \nsince the imputation of questionableness is secondary,  \nas in the case of the assertion that  \ncertain acts of violence which are enjoined are against the dharma,12\nThere is, therefore, no contradiction by language statement;  \nso that we conclude that the proposition is presentable.\nnotes: this \"non-apprehension of what should be there (yogānupalambha) is the criterion by which we know the absence of a thing. Here it is the absence of truth in Pañcarātra that needs be proved by yoganupalambha, if the objector's contention that Pañcarātra is invalid-through-reversion be correct.\nnotes: I have difficulty in understanding the argument unless I assume an illogicality. By stating as his ground since in agama we have its meaning exactly conveyed as it is the objector not only agrees with the preceding argumentation that on inferential grounds Pañcaratra is not invalid, but even goes so far as accepting that it is valid in other words, confuse non-invalidity with validity. \n\nThen, because of this validity (svarthasya tathātvāvabodhanāt), there arises a conflict with a deviating statement of the Veda which has its own validity; since only one can be true, it follows that when Pancarãtra is true by inference, it is untrue by Veda. \n\nBut I don't see how the objector can reasonably infer the validity of Pañcarātra, since its meaning or content is admittedly suprasensible. Yamuna himself has not argued that Inference proves the validity, but that Inference cannot disprove the correctness of the thesis.\n[[134]]\nnotes: a hetvantaram constitutes on the part of the debator a confession of importance  \nsince the ground which he gave does not hold  \nand he has to produce a different ground.  \nBy the rules of debate this means a defeat.\nnotes: Akshapada - The founder of the school of logic.\nnotes: The Vedic injunction na hinṇsyāt sarvabhūtāni \"one should not injure any being\"  \nraises the question of the validity of injunctions which do require injury to beings.  \nBut this is a secondary question which does not affect the validity of the Veda as a whole.  \nSimilarly, the thesis \"Pañcaratra is valid\" is not disproved  \nby the possible mention in the valid Veda  \nof something that conflicts with something in Pañcaratra.  \nSo far the argument is not for validity but against invalidity."

Nor is the ground affected by logical defects, like occasional application etc.\nThe ground is not occasionally applicable to other terms.\n[[48]]  \nThis fallacy of occasionalness is of two kinds, general occasionalness and special occasionalness.  \nAn instance of the first kind provides the ground in the argument:  \n\"The earth is eternal, because it is knowable.\"  \nOf the second kind: \"The earth is eternal, because it, possesses smell.\"\nOur ground, namely,  \n'Pañcaratra is authoritative, because it produces faultless knowledge',  \ndoes not apply equally whether it is authoritative or not,  \nwhich would render the ground generally-occasional.126\nFor this ground, namely its being a cause of faultless knowledge,  \nhas not been found before in the alternative propositions  \nthat Pañcaratra is deceptive and hence nonauthoritative.\nNeither does the ground have a specially occasional application,  \nbecause the illustration \"like statements on Vedic sacrifices such as jyotiṣṭoma etc.\"  \nshows its connection with other instances on the same side of the argument.\nNor is the ground precluded,  \nsince there is no concomitance of its opposite; being a cause of faultless knowledge is not invariably accompanied by nonauthoritativeness.\nNor is the ground cancelled by lapse of time,  \nsince there is no conflict with Perception  \nand in this it is analogous with Scripture.\nNor is the ground itself unproved or unestablished.  \nIf a ground is unestablished,  \nthis is because either its locus or its essence is unestablished.  \nThe first does not apply, for its locus is Pañicarātra Sastra, which is proved to exist.\nNor does the second apply:  \nfor there are three ways in which a ground may be unestablished as to its essence:  \nthrough ignorance, through dubiety, or through reversion.\nIgnorance does not apply,  \nas follows from the fact that the words describing the ground are pronounced.\nNor does dubiety apply,  \nfor that the ground is correct is undoubted and self-evident to the defender of the proposition,  \nwhile for the opponent the same is easily proved by the fact that no defects are apprehended in it.\n[[49]]  \nThat the ground would be unestablished through reversal is utterly out of the question.\n60\\. OBJECTION. But how can we discard the supposition that the Pañcaratra texts are faulty?128  \nThis supposition arises instantly since the texts are of personal origin.\nREFUTATION. How do you avoid the same supposition in the case of the Vedas?  \nThere too it arises instantly, since the Vedas are language-statements.\nWhen you reply, it is avoided because the Vedas have no personal author,  \nthen you may realize that in our case, too, it is avoided, since the Tantras have been composed by the Supreme Person,  \nwho is omniscient and eternally satisfied,  \nand you may keep quiet!\nWhat I mean to say is this.  \n\nOur position is that in language as such there are no defects that invalidate its authority;   \nas language, language is authoritative,\nIts authority is in certain cases invalidated by defects in the character of the speaker,  \nfor instance in a language statement,  \n\"There is a herd of elephants on my finger-tip.\"\nThe statements in the upanisad portion of the Veda  \nremove whatever suspicion we may have  \nabout any defects in the character of the speaker in the text collection here under discussion.\nFor the Vedanta texts set forth that the omniscient Lord of the world is supremely compassionate;  \nthen how can we suppose Him to be deceitful etc.?\nnotes: Since pots are knowable, the ground would also apply to prove the eternality of pots and all things that are knowable. \n\nSince only earth (as an element) possesses smell, this ground has no general applicability.\nnotes: Like the ground \"because it is knowable\" which applies to things regardless of whether they are eternal or not.\nnotes: Obviously, if the ground were not known, it could not be stated.\nnotes: This objection seems to speak to the summary denial that the ground is unestablished through reversion.\nnotes: Be it repeated that the validity, authoritativeness, etc. of Verbal Statements (ie, shabdapramāna) is founded on the basic assumption that statements truly and accurately communicate their things-meant (artha), that a word accurately conveys its meaning.  \nAmong these things meant Yamuna includes facts as well as karyas,  \nhence the following debate with the Prabhakara,"

OBJECTION.  \nHowever, I have said that language statements have no authority  \nwhen they concern established facts,  \non the ground that when terms are applied to such facts  \nthey do not have proper denotative power. \n\n[[50]]\nREFUTATION.  \nThis view is not correct, language, eliciting a fact by direct application,  \neven though this fact is established,  \nreally operates its denoting power  \nas fully as it does  \nby applications which concern karyas.\nConsider the illustration that has been given above (supra § 37.),  \nWhen certain manifestations (of joy) in a man's face,  \nwhich follow on his hearing the statement  \n\"A son has been born to you,\"  \nmake it appear that the man spoken-to is happy,  \none instantly understands  \nthat his happiness is the result of his receiving from this statement  \na knowledge of an agreeable meaning,  \nand one then infers that,  \nfor a medium-aged person too,  \nthis happiness derives from the statement.  \nThus one concludes that,  \nsince this happiness came to exist upon the existence of the statement,  \nthe statement itself has the power to convey an agreeable meaning.\nIf there arises a doubt as to \n\n> which particular ground of happiness  \namongst the many different grounds that may occur according to past, present and future, then consider this.\n(A young boy, who wants to understand the meaning of speech, immediately upon hearing the same statement  \nreceives knowledge that a birth ceremony is being held. )\nHe thinks to himself, \"There must be a reason for this.\"  \nThen he considers,  \n\"Is the agreeable meaning which has been understood from the statement the cause of this knowledge that a birth ceremony is to be held ?\"\nand he realizes that this meaning was precisely this that a son had been born. 13\nAnd on that issue:  \nDefinite knowledge of the denotion of words in a sentence is had through the words that are included or excluded. This being so, [51] words denote their meanings, whether these are established things or not.\n[[51]]\n\n> 62\\. OBJECTION. However, the relation of cause and effect is not just known from the fact that one comes into existence upon the existence of the other, for that would mean over-extension.\n> Nor does the realization that a birth ceremony is to be held follow invariably upon the knowledge of an agreeable meaning;\n> for we find also that the same realization follows upon a feeling of distress, namely when the informed father is vexed by the trouble of maintaining his family.132\n\n132: Then, one may suppose, the child would not so readily associate the birth ceremony with the previous communication.\nREFUTATION. Don't we find that the realization of a kārya is caused by a verbal statement, so that we can agree that, for example, the realization that a cow is to be fetched following a statement \"Fetch the cow\" is indeed caused by that statement?\nWhen you say that, since this realization cannot occur without a cause therefore the proximate statement must in that case be the cause of the realization, then I maintain that the same holds also in the case of \"A son is born.\"\nIt has been decided by our opponent that the verbal denotation of a meaning which causes an action to be taken is a result of the inclusion in the statement of a liṅādi suffix.133 \n\n133: supra §36\\.\nHe who maintains that all words only bear meaningfully on kārya,\nmaintains in effect that padārthas134 exist only in kārya statements and that e.g. in the case of cows, horses and the like, which are related to bodies, their being a padārtha is ascertained by the inclusion or exclusion of the words denoting them in a statement concerning kārya. \n\n134: The things-meant or denoted by the word,\nIf he says, indeed, whenever their being a padārtha is significantly construed, it is construed just as connected with kārya, we reply,  \nStop being obstinate; for verbal exchange is also possible through denotation of words that are connected with other things than kāryas.135\n63\\. It is necessary to accept the position that words are denotative of connected meanings, for otherwise it would be impossible to explain that they are denotative of meanings connected with kāryas.\nThe definition 'the thing meant by a word is always connected with a kārya' fails to cover the defined topic completely;  \nfor it does not apply in the case of injunctive suffixes,\nsince these suffixes denote their own meanings as connected, not with kārya, but with consequences of already established facts, such as proper qualification on the part of the person enjoined etc.\nOr if it is said that in their case there is denotation of connected meanings and in the other case denotation of meanings connected with kārya, we reply that this is a neither old nor young, argument;136  \nit is more appropriate simply to accept the view that there is denotation of connected meanings in general.\n64\\. Therefore, the adherents of all schools should accept that words have proper denotation for the meanings they denote because these meanings are connected with other meanings that are required to complete the sense of the statement, are closely collocated and are appropriate.\nEven if the denoting power of language were to be understood only through its proper signification in kārya statements alone,137  \neven so\nit is correct when we decide the denotation of language to take the standpoint that kārya is just one of the inessential factors of denotation, like the identity of the speaker, the extent of space in which a statement can be heard etc.\nThe logicians hold the view that the meaning of a language statement cannot be known except by language statement.138 Consequently, there exists no inherent relationship with kārya as cause of denotation in uses of words that have their proper signification,  \njust as is the case with floating precious stones on water.\nJust as this floating, however helpful it may be to determine the identity of certain diamonds, e.g. the brahmin diamond, serves no purpose when a stone is being transacted which has already been properly identified, similarly the kārya, however helpful to understand the proper signification of a word, serves no purpose once its proper signification has been identified.\n[[53]]\n\n65\\. Moreover, if words denote their meanings only as connected with kārya, then how can we know from them that, for example, there is a relation between a fruit and a river-bank, as in a statement : \"There is a fruit on the river-bank?\"\nIf you say that a statement of such a substantive relation does not denote the relation it states through its primary sense, but through secondary sense, then, we may ask, where do statements then have their primary sense?\nIf you answer \n\n> in a kārya which is not previously known through other means of knowledge, \n\nwe reply: no, for then no use of words would be possible, since their meaning would not yet have been identified.\nNaturally there can be no knowledge of the meaning of a word  \nwhen that word denotes a meaning not previously known through other means of knowledge,  \nand no cognition can arise from words with unknown meanings,  \nfor that would entail over-extension.\n[[54]]\n\n> 66\\. OBJECTION. My position is this.  \nIn ordinary language a statement is understood to have its proper signification  \nwhen it bears on a kārya that is to be accomplished with a certain action.\n> In Vedic language a statement enjoys a special power of denotation  \nwhich transcends the transitory root-sense of the word \"sacrificing \",  \nand it has this power of denotation  \nbecause it is the means of realizing a certain fruit  \nand acquires this power on account of the collocation of words describing this fruit;\n> whereas in ordinary language,  \nsince there verbal exchange is possible also to the unsophisticated,  \nthis determination of the nature of word and meaning is not attended to.\nREFUTATION. This position is just wishful thinking;\nfor a language statement,  \neven if understood in your way as bearing meaningfully only on a kārya to be accomplished with an action,  \ndoes not by that token set forth a permanent kārya,140  \nsince that would mean over-extension. \n\n139: read na hi kriyākārye vyutpannaḥ sthāyi kāryam.\nIf we cannot know the true connection of words  \neven when the usage of our elders,  \nthrough which the denotations of these words is understood,  \ntakes place in accordance with these words,  \nthen we can never know their connection!\nIf a language statement has lost its postulated true denoting power  \nbecause it is impossible,  \nit does not thereby acquire another denoting power.\nIn such cases we surely must assume lakṣaṇā.\nFor when certain words are collocated that have incompatible meanings, these words do not therefore denote something else altogether, for then all word meanings would become unreliable.\n67\\. Besides, we do not admit that the fact that a word has the power to communicate a kārya that is not previously known through other means of knowledge proves that there actually exists a relationship between itself and the fruit of the action it enjoins.\nThe only relation proved of it is that with injunction, not with instrumentality.  \nThat in a statement there subsists a relation with a kārya  \nwhich transcends the root-sense of the verb  \ncannot be proved except by the relation of kārya with the fruit of the act, and the latter relation cannot be proved without the former.\nAnd therefore there is a vicious interdependence that cannot be refuted.\nIf there is no factor which activates the person who, according to the injunction, is specified by the heaven that is to be achieved,  \nthe injunction itself cannot be the means of achieving the desired heaven.\nThe root-sense of the words being transitory, the statement itself cannot function as this means.141  \nTherefore the assertion that a language statement communicates as its proper meaning a kārya which exceeds this transitory root-sense, cannot be correct.\nA person is not specified by heaven as the object to be achieved,142 but it is the person who desires heaven who is enjoined upon to accomplish the act.   \n\n142: {{Cr.|Cf.}} {{Prakaraṇapañcikā}} p. 182\\.\nHeaven can not be the specification of the person's qualification, because heaven is yet to be achieved.\nOnly something that has already been achieved, that actually exists, can specify the person upon whom an act is enjoined, for instance, the real fact of his being alive etc. Consequently only his desire can specify his qualification for the act.\n[[55]]\n\n68\\. Furthermore, precisely how is heaven, which in your opinion functions as the specification of the person enjoined, an object to be realized, a sādhya?\n[[56]]\n\nIf its being a sādhya means that it is fit for a relation with a sādhana,  \nit is impossible for heaven to be siddha, as long as its relatability obtains,  \nsince it cannot become siddha in the meantime.143\nThe only authority that exists for heaven becoming siddha in the end is the injunction itself, while the only authority for the injunction is just this that heaven does become siddha. This is plainly a vicious circle.\nIf heaven is the sādhya, the injunction is not the sādhya. It is not possible to combine two sādhyas in one sentence.144\n\n\n144: This is the principle of ekavākyatā: a statement can contain only one injunction, otherwise there is vākyabheda: what should be one sentence is split up into two.\n> 69\\. OBJECTION. Indeed, the unity of a sentence is broken up when it contains two sādhyas that are independent, but not when the two are interdependent.\nAnd here the two sādhyas are interdependent since the realization of heaven is contained in the realization of the injunction.\n> That is what the Author says: \"When the niyoga is realized, everything else in accordance with it is also realized;\" and: \"Why should the realization of the fruit not be held to be subservient to the realization of the injunction?\"145 Therefore there is no conflict here.\n\n145: Quotations not identified; but for the argument, see Prakaraṇapañcikā, p 183 f.\nREFUTATION. No; \n\n~~unless heaven is realized, how can the injunction not be realized? Without the realization of heaven neither the qualification, nor the object, nor anything else required by the injunction is realized.~~\n70\\. ~~OBJECTION.~~ In the case of the qualifications for periodical rites the injunction (apUrva) does not require the 'realization of any fruit.'146   \n\n146: No specific fruits are attached to nitya rites.  \n\nNor does an injunction to one act  \nfail to apply to a person who really desires another fruit.\n\nThe pre-eminence147 is really the injunction's;  \na person is enjoined upon by the injunction to any act in the same way  \nas he is enjoined upon to perform the periodical acts.\n\n\n147: māhātmya, which corresponds to prādhānya, pradhānatā.\nFor the injunction draws unto itself the desirous person who himself thinks that the heaven which he desires is the principal object, in the same way as the injunction to perform the periodical acts activates a person, even though he does not desire anything, to these acts which bear no fruit at all.\nBesides, a person who is desirous of heaven also opens and shuts his eyes; for you these actions do not subserve his realization of heaven. Why not consider the sacrificing an action of the same kind?\n> There are some who do not accept that it is a means of realizing heaven. [[57]]\n\n71\\. REFUTATION. If that is the view, we ask: Are the sacrifice etc., which are to be grasped by the cognition that they are such means, eliminated from the injunction?\nOn this point: When the injunction does not mean to convey a relation between the object to be realized and the means of realizing it, then all acts are fruitless.\nTherefore, it is sound to maintain that  \nfrom the injunctive suffixes  \nthere results first the cognition that  \nthey are indeed the means to realize the desired object,  \nand that subsequently the desire for this object prompts a person to undertake the act of realization.\nBut it is improper to maintain that  \n\n> the primary denotation occurs in the expressing of a meaning that was previously unknown,  \n\nand that \n\n> the denotation in the expressing of any other meaning is secondary.\nWe conclude that ordinary, non-Vedic statements give rise to cognitions concerning meanings that are just so established by these statements.\n\n[[58]]\n> 72\\. OBJECTION. But these cognitions do not arise from the denoting power of language, but result from Inference.\n> For these statements, though their denotations in conveying certain meanings are consciously known once their proper meanings have been learnt,  \ndo not furnish complete certainty about their meanings merely upon being heard by a listener,  \nwhen they are accompanied by doubt which is created by the listener's observation that in one case or other statements have deviated from their proper meanings.\n> And, unless there be complete certainty, the meaning will remain unknown; for no knowledge can arise in one's mind from uncertainty.\nIf the meaning of a statement is not known, the listener wants to discover it: \"The speaker uses words whose meanings apparently admit of being connected;\n> and reliable persons do not use words whose connections are unknown;\" \n\nand the listener realizes that therefore the speaker has knowledge of such a connection.\nIf the knowledge of connection is thus inferred, the meaning discovered by the listener does not require the authority of verbal testimony.\n> Consequently, since ordinary language statements are dependent on the speaker's cognition; they terminate in that cognition through Inference alone.\n73\\. REFUTATION. This view is not correct;  \nfor a word conveys its right meaning as its natural function, and the observation that in one case the statement happened to be untrue under the influence of defects in the speaker's character should not give rise to a general suspicion which would cause all statement to give up its natural capacity of conveying its meaning.149\nThe suspicion that a fire may not burn in other cases  \nbecause in one case, when obstructed by mantras, it fails to burn, does not make fire fail to burn!\nAnd the fact that the sense of vision may give rise to a cognition which does not correspond to reality-e.g. that nacre is silver-as the result of some optical error does not signify that the visual sense cannot produce true cognition of the visible presence of a pitcher etc.\nTherefore, a statement does indeed instantly convey a certain meaning to the listener if he knows the relation between the words and their meanings.\nIt does not require knowledge of the basis. Before there is complete knowledge on the part of the listener about the basic knowledge of the speaker, and, further, when the meaning has been expressed, the question rises: \"How does he know this?\" and Inference proceeds to resolve that question.\nYou want to infer: \"Did the speaker know something?\" or wish to infer his knowledge of the connection of the different meanings.\nBut the mere knowledge that the speaker knew something is not enough for utterance and action concerning a statement-meaning to proceed.\nInference of a cognition concerning the connection of different meanings is impossible without a prior cognition of such a connection.  \n\nThis being so, the meaning of the statement must be known first.\nFor cognitions whose particular objects are not connected, are not ~~connected~~ separated themselves.\nNor is a particular meaning established by cognitions that are inferred to be such.\nIf you say that \n\n> any word combination which is able to convey a certain connection produces knowledge of just this connection, \n\nI maintain that the connection of the particular meanings must be known previously;\nunless a connection has already reached the level of cognition it cannot give rise to being expressed in a statement.\n74\\. To conclude, the cognition of an established fact in statements like \"there is a fruit on the riverbank\" is strictly of verbal origin and does not arise from Inference.\nTherefore the position that statements produce valid knowledge only if they deal with a previously unknown kārya\nis taken only by people whose judgments are stultified by their continuous preoccupation with their own theories.  \nIn the manner set forth above  \nit is true that statements may bear meaningfully and informatively on other meanings as well.\nConsequently, all the statements of the Upaniṣads which set forth the existence of a categorically different Person\ne.g. \n\n> \"He is the overlord of the Universe, \n\n> sovereign of all. \n\n> He commands all the world,\"150 \n\n\"All this is manifest to Him\" etc.\nare authoritative as to what they state, since they produce indubitable and unreversed knowledge of their contents.\n\n[[60]]\n[[29]]  \n35\\. To continue this topic,  \nthese scriptural statements do not exceed the bounds of their authority  \njust because they are concerned with facts;  \nfor similar statements made by persons concerning facts that are extremely remote from a connection with other means of knowledge  \ncannot be denied the authority which is afforded them naturally.\nNor do statements concerning a fact lack authority  \nbecause of the consideration that since either a proving or disproving factor may unexpectedly turn up  \nthere remains the possibility that this fact is thus repeated or reversed;  \nfor the same may equally well happen to a statement concerning, not a fact, but a karya.\nA kārya, too, may be known from other means of knowledge,  \nfor it must be admitted that ordinary karyas, like 'fetch firewood'  \nare also known through other means of knowledge,  \nas in the case of the cooking of the odana.\nOr if it be claimed that,  \ninasmuch as a karya concerning a categorically different thing like the agnihotra etc. cannot conceivably find any other authority,  \ntherefore the verbal testimony which sets forth such a thing must needs be its authority,\nwell, then we may say that there is not a ghost of another authority for the Bhagavan  \nwhose form consists in unsurpassed knowledge, supremacy and beatitude;  \nso that it should follow that everything is entirely the same in both cases,  \ndepending on one's particular partisan views.\nMoreover, \n\nif a cognition concerning a content  \nthat is also known through another means of knowledge  \ndoes not recognize its own content as authoritative,  \nsince it has already been taken care of by another authority,\nthis non-authoritativeness of its content is beyond experience  \nfor it is a mere matter of assumption.\nTherefore it must be maintained that all indubitable and unreversed knowledge is authoritative, regardless of whether its content is established, or yet to be performed, or anything else.\nnotes: Yamuna here takes up the Prabhakara's theory that a child learns the meaning of language  \nthrough the action his elders take on hearing a statement,  \nso that the denotativeness of language is defined by its injunctiveness.  \nHe uses the Prabhakara's example of the factual statement: \n\"A child is born to you.\"  \nA child who does not know language has no way of understanding the meaning of this statement  \nbecause the young father's happiness conveys nothing specific.  \n\nBut, asks Yamuna, suppose the same child has witnessed his father reception of the cheering news  \nand the subsequent preparations for a birth ceremony.  \nSince one follows immediately upon the other,  \nthe child associates one with the other  \nand can thus understand the meaning of the statement,  \nthough the statement itself was no injunction,  \nbut a communication of an established fact,\nnotes: This starts the discussion of the Prabhakara theory on the limitations of the validity of verbal statements.  \nFirst general Mimāmsā views on the subject are discussed.\nnotes: The validity of shabda lies in its communicating contents that cannot be known through other means of knowledge.  \nWhat I translate as 'facts' are more literally \"established [[129]] entities,\" established, that is, by other means of knowledge than shabda.  \nA scriptural statement of the kind \"grass is green\" is not strictly valid  \nin the sense that, in order to know that grass is green, we need a scriptural statement to that effect.\n\nAnother proving factor, c.g., the means of knowledge Perception, may turn up conceivably  \nand thus make the scriptural statement superfluous;  \nor we may find that grass is not invariably green, but changes its colour,  \nwhich would reverse the scriptural statement.\n\nScriptural validity, i.e., Scripture's being a means of knowledge, is to the Prabhakara Mimimsaka, its being the sole means of knowing a particular thing.  \nTo the Prabhakara this validity is ideal in the case of injunctions concerning actions which, suprasensibly, lead to a certain desired end.\nnotes: (The injunction concerning the odana oblation includes an injunction concerning the preparation of the odana and the fetching of firewood for the cooking. Since experience shows that for a cooking fire one needs firewood, this karya is not strictly known on scriptural authority.)"

                                "commentary": "Hence we reject our opponent's position. [[61]]  \n76\\. The objections that omniscience is acquired by means of the regular senses is incorrect,\nbecause śruti contradicts it:\n\"He sees without eyes,  \nhears without ears;  \nhe who does not see with the eye,  \nwho sees the eyes,  \nhas neither effect nor instrument;\"153 \n\n153: Śvet Up. 3\\.19\\.\n> \"knowledge, strength and action are natural to Him,\"154 \n\netc. \n\n154: Śvet Up. 6\\.8\\.\nThese śrutis do not speak metaphorically,  \nfor there is no authority for this assumption.\nMetaphorical usage is assumed when the primary meanings of the śrutis make no sense.  \nSince the primary meaning here makes sense, the assumption of metaphorical use is baseless.\n[[62]]\n\n77\\. OBJECTION. But in this case we have in fact reason to cancel the primary meaning, because the primary sense militates against other means of knowledge.\nREFUTATION. What other means of knowledge? Not, to start, Perception,\nfor we see no Perception occur which shows that the said Person is non-existent.\nIf you retort that non-existence is decided by the nonapprehension of what should be there,  \nwe reply that this does not hold in our case since the object,  \nthat is the said Person, is actually apprehended through Scripture itself, which is the highest-ranking among the assembly of the means of knowledge.\nNor does it militate against Inference;\nfor how could an Inference which disproves that Person arise at all, slow-moving as it is, when its object is instantly refuted by the rapidly arising scriptural cognition?\nMoreover, if this were so, the relation of sacrificing etc. to heaven, apūrva155 etc. (155: cf supra note.), would logically be contradicted by the fact that sacrificing etc. are actions, when Scripture did not cancel such reasoning.\nTrue, the identity of sacrificial pole and sun, which is asserted by Scripture, is cancelled by another means of knowledge, namely Perception alone, because the difference between a piece of wood and the disc of the sun is indeed obvious.\nBesides, in this case it is legitimate to assume metaphorical usage, for the statement of this identity is an arthavāda,156 since it forms one single statement with the proximate injunction about the unction of the sacrificial pole. \n\n156: supra note 86\\.\nThere is no other injunction to which it could be accessory as an arthavāda.157 \n\n157: supra § 36\\.\n> Alternatively, inasmuch as the human importance of a statement would be lost if there were no injunction to connect it with, an injunction may be supplemented and then the arthavāda is regarded as accessory to that supplemented injunction.\n[[63]]\n\n> 78\\. The objection158 that as long as statements fail to prompt the operator of the means of knowledge to being active or to prevent him from being active, they do not communicate self-sufficient information,\ndoes not hold good.\nFor, we find that statements have human importance also outside any connection with an injunction; in such a case it will be as in the statement “A son has been born to you,\" and the like.\nNor need an injunction be supplemented in these cases. For without an injunction, too, joy arises from the information that a son has been born.\nLikewise, a statement which is self-sufficient in merely expressing particular actions which questioners want to know in exchanges of question and answer-e.g. \"Which action?\" \"Cooking!\"-do not require the supplementation of an injunction.\nIn the upaniṣadic texts the knowledge of brahman is declared to be rewarded by great bliss: \"the brahman-knower becomes brahman\";159 \"the brahman-knower attains the supreme\";160\n\"the sāman cantor attains with brahman  \nall that he desires:\"161  \nthe human importance of statements without injunctions is quite clear from these and other scriptural words.\nTo sum up, when it is established that the Bhagavān is the treasury solely of beautiful qualities of direct universal cognition, compassionateness etc., qualities which are true and natural to Him, and which we know from hundreds of quoted śrutis, then it is also established that the Tantra which is based on His universal cognition is authoritative indeed."

Granted that, as you have described it, there exists some Person who is endowed with natural omniscience, as it is known from the upaniṣads, yet, unless it is absolutely certain that this Person is indeed Hari, Pañcaratra will not be authoritative.\nREFUTATION. This is a worthless remark; no experts in the Veda dispute that the Supreme Soul, cause of the entire universe, is Vāsudeva.\nFor He is revealed in the upaniṣads as the Supreme Soul: \"Truth, knowledge, infinite; that is the supreme step of Viṣṇu. Vāsudeva is the ultimate matter, the ultimate spirit\".161\n> He was alone beyond who became this world;162 \"higher than whom there is nothing at all\".  \n\nIn accordance with the subject expressed in these statements there are passages like: \n\n\"From whom these beings...\" \"Sat alone, my son...\"  \n\nTherefore Viṣṇu's perfect knowledge is established by the upaniṣads.\nAnd it is not declared in śruti that the origination, subsistence and destruction of the world are caused by anyone but Him. Hence there is a consensus that He is the supreme omniscient soul.\nThat He is the Supreme Soul we learn also from the statements of Dvaipāyana, Parāśara, Nārada and other great seers. \n\nThus -\n> \"Know thou, O tormentor of thy foes, that the entire world rests on Viṣṇu. The Great Viṣṇu creates the totality of creatures, moving and unmoving.\n> In him they go to their reabsorption, from Him they originate,\"\n\"The glorious Sage Nārāyaṇa, without beginning or end, is the sovereign Lord. He creates the creatures, those that stand still and those that move.\"163 \n\n163: not identified.\nThat He is the Supreme Brahman is also learnt elsewhere.\n> \"Kesava, O best of the Bhāratas, the Blessed One, is the sovereign, the supreme soul, the entire universe: thus it stands revealed in many places of the Scripture.\"164 \n\n164: not identified.\n> For those who seek to know the supreme principle by means of many-sided reasonings Hari alone is the Principle, the great Yogin, Nārāyaṇa the Lord.165\nLikewise in the Dānadharma, \n\n> \"Padmanābha is the Supreme Soul, the highest One, the pure One, the Refuge. This is the secret doctrine of the Veda; dost thou not know, sacker of cities?\n> By His grace do we all cause the worlds to exist. And the trusted ones, and the first among the immortals, and the gods are held to be His representatives, If Viṣṇu is indifferent, no good will come to us.\"\nThus Rudra's word.166 Similarly, in the Mahābhārata and Matsya Purāṇa, \n\n166: Viṣṇu Pur., 1\\.1\\.31\\.\n> \"He who amongst them is the Supreme Soul, He indeed is the eternal, unqualified, perfect One; He is to be known as Nārāyaṇa, for He is the world-soul, the Spirit.\"\nLikewise in the Varāha Purāṇa, \n\n\"Who, excepting the Lord Nārāyaṇa, is superior to the God whose conduct has become the life-order on the earth?\"\n\"There has been no God greater than Nārāyaṇa, nor shall there be; this is the secret doctrine of the Vedas and the Purāṇas, O excellent ones.\"\nLikewise in the Liṅga Purāṇa, \n\n> \"Janārdana is the sole Spirit, the highest One, the Supreme Soul, from whom Brahmā was born;  \nfrom Him Rudra and from Him all the world.\"\nLikewise Parāśara's word, \n\n> The world has originated from Viṣṇu and on Him it rests.  \nHe is the maker of its subsistence and its destruction.\"\n167 Likewise in the Mānavadharmaśāstra,168  \n\n\"Nārāyaṇa is higher than the unmanifest; the World-Egg originates from the unmanifest. Within the Egg are all these worlds as well as the earth with her seven continents.\" \n\n167: Not in {{Manusmrti|Manusmṛti}}.\nTherefore, the study of these and similar śrutis, smṛtis, epical texts and Purāṇas proves that Vāsudeva is the universal cause, the Supreme Soul.\n80\\. Nor do the śrutis declare that Rudra is the Supreme Soul, or that any other deity is. On the contrary, the followers of the Ekāyana śākhā 169 say that he has an origin,  \n\n168: A little known Vedic branch (if it was a Vedic tradition), from which certain Vaiṣṇava sects derive their authority; cf. infra §138\\.\nand the same is found in the Veda itself:  \n\n> \"Darkness was here....  \nfrom which Rudra is born;  \nthat is the greatest in all the worlds,\" \n\n169: These quotations could not be identified.\n\"that indeed is the oldest in the worlds.\"\nSimilarly, Rudra's position is clearly known to be a result of his karman: \"He obtained his greatness by propitiating Viṣṇu.\"\n\"From the forehead sprang a drop; from that Rudra was born,\"170  \nThese and other śrutis declare that Rudra was born. \n\n170: BĀ Up 4\\.1\\.5\\.\nThis being so, the statements that in appearance convey the greatness of Rudra and others really serve as laudatory statements, like the śruti: \"the ear is brahman.\"\n\n[[67]]\nConsequently, the passages in the Purāṇas which declare Rudra etc. to be the Supreme Soul have not their primary meaning, because they are in conflict with ~~Perception and~~ clear Scripture.\n81\\. Concerning the objection that the assertions of the doctrines of the Tantras are to be rejected  \nsince their greatness is set forth only in non-Vedic Tantric texts,\nwe say that Viṣṇu is stated to be the Supreme One in the texts of the Way of the Vedic doctrine.\nFor example in the Viṣṇu Purāṇa, \"The Supreme Soul, the Basis of all creatures, the Supreme Lord is called by the name of Viṣṇu in Vedas and Upaniṣads.\"171 \n\n171: Viṣṇu Pur. 6\\.4\\.40\\.\nIn the Varāha Purāṇa, \"The Supreme Brahman is Viṣṇu; the triple division in the pathways of the Vedic doctrine is here set forth; the ignorant do not know this.\"172 \n\n172: cf. Varāha Pur., 72\\.4, which reads pūjyate in b.\n\"There has been no god greater than Nārāyaṇa, nor shall there be; this is the secret doctrine of Vedas and Purāṇas, O excellent ones.\"173\nLikewise in the Matsya Purāṇa, \"In those aeons where sattva prevails, the greatness of Viṣṇu is declared. In aeons predominated by tamas the greatness of Fire and Śiva is expounded.\"174 \n\n174: Matsya Pur. 290\\.15\\.\nLikewise in the Liṅga Purāṇa, \n\n> \"For there is no other recourse ordained but Viṣṇu; this the Vedas constantly declare, no doubt about it.\"175 \n\n175: The Liṅga, Vāyu and Bhaviṣyat quotations could not be verified.\n[[68]]\n\nLikewise in the Vāyu Purāṇa,\n\n\"The Spirit that belongs to the Way of the Veda is explained to be the thousand-armed supreme lord of creatures.\"\nLikewise in the Bhaviṣyat Purāṇa, \"Visnu is traditionally known to be the Supreme in the pathways of the Vedic doctrine. Viṣṇu is the greatest among persons, the most exalted Supreme Person.\"\nAll this has already been explained in great detail in the Puruṣanirṇaya 176 and is therefore not further enlarged upon here. \n\n176: Title of one of Yāmuna's treatises."

                                "commentary": "83\\. This argument cannot be extended to other Tantras,  \nfor in the various authors of those Tantras error etc. is possible.\nIt is impossible that Perception [[69]] \nor another means of knowledge forms the basis for the other Tantras,  \nand they themselves do also not claim that Scripture is the basis.\nBesides, because they communicate a meaning  \nthat is incompatible with the conclusions of the upanisads  \nthe view that these Tantras are based on Perception or Scripture is sublated.\nFor there are four kinds of followers of the way of life set forth in those Tantras,\nthe Kāpālikas, Kālamukhas, Pasupatas and Saivas.  \nThe Kapalika doctrine is described as follows:\nthe reward of release is attained by knowing  \nwhat the six mudrikas are and by wearing them,  \nnot by knowing Brahman.\nAs they say, \n\n> \"He who knows the identities of the six mudrikas  \n> and is expert in the supreme Mudra,  \n> and meditates upon the self in the vulva posture, attains nirvana.\"\nThe six mudrikas of the Kāpālikas are stated to be the earring, necklace, pendent, head ornament, ashes and the sacrificial thread:\nthere are two more subsidiary mudras described, namely skull and skull-staff.  \nOne whose body is marked by these mudras will not be reborn in the world.\"\nNow, the śrutis do not bear out their view that the knowledge of such paraphernalia, the wearing of them  \nand the concentration on the body in the immoral vulva posture  \nare means to attain release,\nfor the śrutis expound that  \nrelease is attainable only by one who has renounced all sensual desires of this world and the other world  \nand who concentrates on the soul Vasudeva as the cause of the entire Universe:\n\"knowing Him one goes beyond death;  \nthere is no other path to tread etc.\" (Svet Up. 3.8.)\nThe same is. true of the Kalamukhas who teach \nthat certain practices,  \nwhich are condemned by all the [[70]] sāstras,  \nlike eating from a skull,  \nbathing in and tasting of ashes of cremated corpses,  \ncarrying a laguḍa staff,  \nputting up wine-cups and worshipping the deity in them,  \nwill secure all material and immaterial desires:  \nthese teachings are outside the Veda.\n84\\. Also some of the teachings of the Pasupatas and the Saivas  \nin which compatible and incompatible elements are indiscriminately mixed  \nare likewise outside the Veda,\nThe Pasupata system is as follows:\nthere are individual souls which are called paśus, cattle,  \nand their overlord is Siva, the Lord of Cattle.  \nTo assist the souls Siva has composed the Paficādhyāyi. (\"The Doctrine of the Five Chapters.\")\nThere the five Categories are explained, namely,  \nCause, Effect, Injunction, Yoga and the Cessation of Misery.\nThe Cause is of two kinds, material and instrumental.  \nRudra is the instrumental cause  \nand a sixteenth part of him is the material cause.\nThe Effect comprises the elements from Mahat to earth.  \nThe Injunction is stated to comprehend principally a number of rites, secret practices, bathing and lying in ashes etc. 182\nThe Yoga is said to be concentration and the muttering of formula, OM etc.   \nThe Cessation of Misery is held to be release;   \nThe term \"cessation' of misery\" means total and final cessation of misery.  \nthus the five Categories are enumerated.\nThe system holds that this cessation or release is defined by the annihilation of all the qualities of the differential soul.\nThis conception of God is held by the Saivas as well as the others.\n[[71]]  \nAnd this view of God is entirely, incompatible with Scripture, for\nit is revealed in śruti that the Supreme Brahman is both the material and the instrumental cause of the Universe.  \nAlso, it is repeatedly revealed in the scriptures that release consists in perfect bliss.\nAs the authoritativeness of these Tantras is already vitiated by their mutual contradictions,  \nit is not really necessary for them to be rejected with the stick of the Veda.\n85\\. Moreover, the Saivas etc. accept stages of life etc.  \nthat are outside the varnasrama system  \nthat is proved by the Veda  \nand are consequently outside the Veda.\nAs they say,\" merely by entering Consecration one becomes instantly a Brahmin.  \nA man becomes an ascetic by accepting the Kāpālika vow.\"\n86\\. Let it not be said, How could Rudra, who is very trustworthy, promulgate such a vast collection of texts which are not authoritative?\nNor is it right to hold  \n that these texts are based upon the recollection of an author of the same name as Siva,  \n because the ground is overextensive.\nFor the theory that the author was in error  \nand could be in error,  \nbecause he was not Siva  \nbut some other person with the same name,  \ncan only follow if the Veda sublates the system;  \nthis latter ground is sufficient to prove the lack of authority of these texts  \nand entails no overextension to other texts.\nAnd error is not entirely impossible in the case of such persons as Rudra etc.\nOr else one may reason that since Rudra may have composed such a system  \nfor the purpose of deceiving the world  \nbecause he is known as a promulgator of deceitful doctrines,  \nit is not even necessary to assume error on his part.\n[[72]]  \nFor thus it reads in the Varaha Purana, \n\n> \"For Thou, strong-armed Rudra, must cause deluding doctrines to be expounded, \n> the deceptions of jugglers (sic) and the like as well as conflicting practices.\n> Having shown that the fruit can be won with little effort,  \n> you must delude all these people quickly.\"84\nSimilarly, the venerable Rudra himself shows in the same Purana  \nthat the Saiva and the like scriptures which are there being discussed  \nare apostate from the Veda,  \nthat only apostates from the Veda are qualified for these doctrines \nand that their only purpose is just to deceive them.\n\"I have propounded this sastra  \nas though it were correct doctrine  \nin order to deceive those who have deserted the Way of the Veda.185\nFrom that time onward, O excellent Ones,  \nthe people who believe in the scriptures promulgated by myself  \ndo not respect the Vedas.16\nThus the Pasupata and like doctrines are active in the Kali Age.\nLikewise he shows that the worship concerning himself  \nas it is propounded in the Pasupata Tantras and other such Tantras  \nis different  \nand does not form part of the worship of the Bhagavan:\n\"The said act of worship concerning me which is being observed is really outside the Veda.  \nThis ritual called Pasupata is the lowliest and deceives men.188\"\n\"Only the lowest people worship me with exclusion of Visņu.\"  \nThe large numbers of statements like the preceding ones will not be written out here,  \nbecause they are too numerous.\nIt is clear enough that those who follow these scriptures  \nare outside the Veda,\nas is stated in the same Purana: \n\n> \"He cursed those who kept the observances of hairtuft, ashes and skull,  \n> Be you outside the Veda and disqualified for Vedic rites.\n[[73]]\nIn the Kali Age all those who assume that appearance,  \nwearing hairtuft and carrying a laguḍa stick, exhibitng arbitrary observances and carrying false lingas about,  \nall these hair-tuft wearing devotees of Rudra are consumed by the fire of Brahma's curse.\"  \n(not identified.)\nThese practices are well-known in the Saiva scriptures:\n\"Rosary, and bracelet in the hand, a hair-tuft on the head, a skull, bathing in ashes etc,\"\nSimilarly, he declares in the Aditya Purana that  \nalong with relinquishing the Bhagavan they relinquish the Veda:\n\"Others, those that wear ashes and hair-tufts as described  \nhave formerly been made to relinquish the Veda  \nas well as God Nārāyaṇa on account of Gautama's curse.\"\nMoreover, those fools who pass censure on Vasudeva  \nare to be regarded as heretics,  \nfor thus it is declared in the Linga Puriņa,\n\"Those who consider the Supreme Person to be equal (to Siva)  \nare to be regarded as heretics who are expelled from the Way of the Veda,\" (not identified.)\nTo conclude, it is these followers of other Tantras of whom it is said, in the smrtis:  \n\"Heretics, criminals etc.\", that they should not be honoured even with a word;\nand the declaration \"Which are outside the Veda...\"  refers to them.  \nConsequently, since it cannot properly be said of the other Tantras  \nthat they are based either on Veda or on Perception,  \nanother cause must be assumed for them.\n87\\. OBJECTION. If it is true that for these Tantras another basis must be assumed,  \nlet the defect be granted. \nBut is in your own view knowledge not self-proved?\n[[74]]   \nREFUTATION.  \nCertainly; but this self-validity of knowledge is here negated by these two defects of sublation,  \nnamely, sublation through ~~Perception~~ origin and through Scripture,  \nfor both these defects are plain in their case.\nThe equality of Pañcaratra Tantra and those other Tantras  \nwhich has been postulated on the ground that both happen to be Tantra,  \nwhile in fact one of the two is incompatible with Scripture and plainly shows a different provenance,\nwould mean that Brahmin Murder and Horse Sacrifice are on the same level because both are actions, (which are seen in the scripture, For in that case, we've determined their source).  \n~~For in the case of Pañcaratra Sastra we have positive certainty that it is based on Scripture and Perception.~~\nnotes: External signs worn by Saiva sectarians.\nnotes: Mahat - The highest material evolute; the sloka is out of order.\n\nThe text reads güṭhācāramukhasmasānabhasitāvasānaḥ pareļi??, which is a corruption; I read, wholly conjecturally gūḍhācabhasmasnānaśa yanādikrijāparaḥ.\nnotes: The text reads yogo dharanam ucjate hydi dhiyām onkarapuream tatha, and seems out of order.

                                "commentary": "89\\. OBJECTION.  \nBut if the Pañcaratra traditions are really derived from the Veda,  \nthen how is it that no recollection of the Vedic words which furnishes this basis  \nhas persisted among the Pañcaratrikas,  \nwhereas the meaning of these words apparently does persist?\nIt is not right to contend that  \nonly the recollection of the meaning is important  \nbecause that has purpose  \nwhile the recollection of the actual Vedic statements is to be disregarded  \nbecause it is purposeless;  \nfor it is not proper to forget that from which the meaning's authority derives.\n[[75]]  \nOr if, in order to justify this oblivion,  \nthe standpoint is taken that the doctrine is based on a Vedic sakha which has been lost or which is always deducible,\nthen whatever doctrine a person adopts  \nhe can always make authoritative simply by attributing it to a lost śākhā;  \nhowever, it is hard to prove what a lost or deducible śākhā actually contain.\nOr if these traditions are based on an extant Sakha,  \nthen others would know it as well as the author,  \nand hence his taking the trouble of promulgating these texts would be purposeless.\nREFUTATION.  \nThe reply to this is as follows:  \nThe Bhagavan, who has an immediate presentation of the entire collection of the Veda  \nby virtue of the perfect knowledge that is natural to Him,  \nobserved that his devotees were not firm enough in their minds  \nto retain and transmit the lessons of all the various sakhas  \nwhich consist of widely scattered injunctions, arthavadas and mantras of many different kinds,  \nand having observed this he was moved by his compassion  \nto condense the meaning of the Veda in an easily comprehensible way and to teach it so.  \nOn this showing, nothing is unestablished.\nAs they say \n\n> \"The blessed Hari took the essence of the Upanisads and condensed it,  \nthe Sage, out of compassion with his devotees for their convenience.\"\nThe other objections made,  \nwhich are equally applicable to all Traditions of Manu and the others,  \nare easily answered by all those who have made a diligent study of the commentaries on the Tantras and are not further enlarged upon here.  \n\n[[76]]\n90\\. OBJECTION.  \nThe thesis that the Pañcarātra Tantras are based on the Veda  \nis disproved by the fact that  \nwe find in these very Tantras a condemnation of the Veda.\nFor it is said that \n\n> Sandilya, failing to find a meaning of human importance in the four Vedas, learnt this shastra.\nREFUTATION.  \nThis is the objection of someone  \nwho does not know the distinct meaning of the statement.  \nFor this censure does not mean to censure something deserving of censure,  \nbut rather to praise something else than that which is censured.\nFor instance, in the Aitareya Brahmana  \nthe censure passed on the pre-dawn oblation  \n\"Morning upon morning they speak untruth,\"  \nis understood to praise the post-dawn oblation.\nIt is as in the Manavadharma Shastra (Manusmrti, 4.124.):  \n\n> \"The Rgveda is of gods and deities,  \n> the Yajurveda of man,  \n> and the Samaveda of the deceased;  \n> therefore its sound is impure;\" \n\nhere the censure of the Samaveda serves to praise the other Vedas.\nOr as in the Mahabharata (Mahabharata 1.265 f):  \n\"Formerly the assembled seers placed the four Vedas and the Mahabharata in the balance,  \none at one side, the other at the other side.  \nAnd since in bulk and in weight the latter preponderated,  \nit is called the Great Bharata for its bulk and weight.\"  \nThis is said, not to belittle the Vedas,  \nbut to bestow praise on the Mahabharata.\nIn this same way the above statement must be taken as praise of the Pancarãtra.\nJust as the censure of the pre-dawn oblation etc.  \ndoes not really intend censure,  \nsince elsewhere in the same texts they are praised,  \nso will it be in our case too.\n[[77]]  \nIn Pañcaratra, too, we frequently find praise of the Veda;\nfor example: \"Nothing that is made up of words is superior to the Veda,  \nthou who art seated on the Lotus.  \nThat is said by the Upanisads which set forth the knowledge of truth\"  \netc.\n91\\. Besides in the quotation caturşu vedeşu  (supra §17)  \nthe meaning is not that there is no purpose of human importance in the Vedas  \nbut simply \"failing to find the purpose of human importance which is in the Vedas...\"\nOBJECTION. However, the principal connection in this sentence is between  \n\"failing to find\" and \"a purpose of human importance;\"  \nnot between \"purpose of human importance\" and \"in the Vedas.\"\nREFUTATION. Don't argue like that,  \nfor there is no negation in the sentence.\nFor it is not so that this purpose of human importance is absent from the Vedas;  \nhence the sentence \"failing to find that purpose of human importance which is in the Vedas,  \nand desirous of finding it,  \nhe learnt the Pañcarātra Sastra,\"  \nconveys that both Revelation and Pañcaratra have the same meaning.\n92\\. The further objection (Supra § 17) that Pañcaratra is non-Vedic because of the injunction that  \nthose who are qualified for Vedic sacraments etc.  \nmust undergo such sacraments described as Consecration  \nbecause they are propitiations of the Lord,  \ndoes not hold good.  \nFor such statements as agnavaiṣṇavam.. 201  \nwhich enjoin the sacrament of consecration upon those qualified for Initiation etc. as accessory to the ritual of the jyotiştoma etc.  \ndo not therefore become non-Vedic.\n[[78]]  \nOr if the ground for its non-Vedic character is the injunction of sacraments other than the Vedic ones,  \nthe ground is inappropriate,  \nbecause of the circular argument it involves:  \nonly if the non-Vedic character of Pancarātra Sastra is proved,  \nit is proved that these sacraments are really different;  \nand if the latter is proved, it is proved that Pañcaratra Sastra is non Vedic.\nMoreover, the ground is either that the Pancarātra sacraments are different from all Vedic sacraments,  \nor that they are different from some Vedic sacraments.\nNot the latter alternative,  \nfor this would mean that the sacrament of Initiation ctc. is non-Vedic  \nbecause it is different from the sacrament of Tonsure;\nnor the first alternative,  \nbecause it does not escape the said defect?  \nfor the sacrament of Initiation is not different from all Vedic sacraments;  \nand we have said that the difference (of Pañcarātra sacraments) from Vedic sacraments  \nis disproved on the ground that Pañcarātra Sastra is Vedic.\n93\\. The objection (supra § 17) that Pancarātra is outside the Veda,  \nbecause like the Pasupata Tantra it is not included among the fourteen sciences  \nwhich are held to be authoritative of dharma,  \nwould also have an occasional application to the texts of the Bharata and Rāmāyaṇa composed by Dvaipayana and Valmiki.\nThe objection that Pancharatra is non-Vedic  \nbecause it is rejected by the blessed Badarayana is incorrect.  \nFor how could the blessed dvaipAyana be thought to reject the Bhagavata doctrine,  \nwhile he himself is a supreme Bhagavata,  \nmodel for the all the world?\n notes:[[140]] The author of the Brahmasutras is identified with Vyasa Dvaipayana, composer of the Mahabharata\n[[79]] \nThis has been extracted from the Bharata in its full length of thousand Slokas after it had been churned with the stick of thought,  \nas butter is extracted from curds,\nand curds from milk,  \nthe Brahmin from the bipeds,  \nthe Aranyaka from the Vedas,  \nand the amṛta from the herbs\nthis Mahopanisada which is consistent with the four Vedas and the demonstrations of Sankhya and Yoga is called the Pañcaratra.\nThis is bliss, this is brahman,  \nthis is the summum bonum.  \nBeing consistent with Rk, Yajuh and Saman and the Atharvāngirasas,\nthis discipline will of a certainty be authoritative. (Mahabharata, 12 340 (129.76) ff.)\nAnd in the Bhismaparvan too: \n\n\"Brahmins, Ksatriyas, Vaisyas and Sūdras as described are all to worship, serve and honour Madhava\naccording to the Satvata ritual that has been promulgated by Samkarṣaṇa,  \nat the end of the Dvapara age and the beginning of the Kali age.\" (Mahabharata, 6.66 (3012).)\nAlso in the Śāntiparvan: \n\n> \"Certainly, the Vaiṣṇava must undergo Consecration with all effort: for Hari will be particularly graceful to one who has been consecrated and to no one else.204 \n\n204: Mahabharata not identified.\nOne should consecrate a Brahmin in spring, a Kṣatriya in summer, a Vaiśya in the autumn, a Śūdra in winter, a woman in the rainy season according to the Pañcarātra doctrine.\"205 \n\n205: Mahabharata not identified.\nAnd likewise: \"It has been made commensurate with the four Vedas on the great Mountain Meru.\"206 \n\n206: Mahabharata not identified.\nNow, how could Dvaipāyana reject the Pañcaratra, which is his own supreme doctrine, comprising the sense of the Upaniṣads, as follows from these and a hundred direct and circumlocutory declarations made with full respect?\n\n[[80]]\nnotes: āgnavaisNava, name of a sacrificial cake offered at the dikşaniyeşti.\nnotes: [[140]] The author of the Brahmasutras is identified with Vyasa Dvaipayana, composer of the Mahabharata"

What is the intention of the sūtra?\nOBJECTION. The following: Since it is expounded in the Bhāgavata Śāstra that the individual soul has an origin, and since this is impossible as it militates against Scripture and Logic, therefore this śāstra is erroneous.\nREPLY. If that is the meaning of the sūtra,  \nthe sūtra is intended to reject the Pāñcarātra Śāstra.\n\n~~then how can the sūtra be intended to reject the Pāñcarātra Śāstra?~~\nFor the Pāñcarātra Śāstras do not accept that the individual soul has an origin, which assumption would have justified the sūtra's rejection.\n> OBJECTION. But is it not their assertion that Vāsudeva is at once the supreme material cause and the supreme spirit; that from him the individual soul Saṅkarṣaṇa is born, from Saṅkarṣaṇa the mind called Pradyumna, and from the latter the ego called Aniruddha?\nREPLY. NO. The personal manifestation of God is described as being constituted by vyūhas,208 \n\n208: 'Divisions' of the Supreme God as Vāsudeva, Saṅkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha.\nand the word \"individual soul\" is assigned to one of these vyūhas for practical purposes, in order to prove clearly the differences that exist within the Adorable One, which differences are in accordance with those of the varṇas.\nIt is as they say: \"The four vyūhas are to be worshipped successively by the four varṇas successively.\"\nBesides, the words 'individual soul,' 'mind' and 'ego' do not denote these tanmātras 209 themselves, but refer to a person who is the superintending deity of these orders and whose personality is entirely different from the order he superintends. \n\n(209: tanmātras here in the sense of the \"higher evolutes.\" )\nBirth is described as the acquisition of various bodies, as is said in the statement toyena jīvān in the Yajurmūrdhan.210 \n\n210: toyena jīvān vyasarjayad bhūmyām, MahānārUp., 1\\.4\\.\nBesides, the Author of the Sūtras has already discarded the śruti, smṛti and profane views concerning the origination and reabsorption of the individual soul in the sūtra carācaravyapāśrayas tu syāt tadvyapadeśo bhāktas tadbhāvabhāvitvāt.211 \n\n211: BrS. 2\\.3\\.16 (17). Translation: \"A word descriptive of moving or unmoving beings, has got a secondary meaning [in referring to Brahman], because such a being's existence depends on Brahman's existence.\"\nAnd since, moreover, the origination of the individual soul out of Brahman has been rejected in the sūtras \n\n> \"nātmā śruter nityatvāc ca tābhyaḥ\",212 \n\nit does not occasion a renewed exposition:  \nan issue which does not need being made a topic would then be made a topic.\n\n \n212: BrS., 2\\.3\\.17 (18). Translation: \n\n> \"The ātman is not born  \nbecause there is no śruti to that effect,  \nand because of its eternality, which is proved by the śrutis.\"\n[[81]]\n\n96\\. This also explains the sūtra na ca kartuḥ karaṇam;213  \n\n213: BrS, 2\\.2\\.43\\.\nfor it is not said here  \nthat the instrument, Sc. the mind, originates from the agent, sc. Saṅkarṣaṇa.\nFor we have already stated that these names solely refer to the persons who uperintend these orders but are themselves different from them\nOBJECTION. Then why this sūtra at all?\n> For we do not find that instruments, like a hatchet, originate from an agent, like Devadatta, so that an instrument out of an agent makes no sense.\nREFUTATION. Well, then you reject the general view that all instruments, vital airs, mind etc. have their origin in Brahman which itself is without the entire collection of all instruments and rests solely on its own power; this view is stated in the text: \"From it springs the vital air, the mind and all the senses.\"214 \n\n214: Muṇḍ Up., 2\\.1\\.3\\.\nOr if you do agree on this because it is clearly proved in Revelation, I ask you why you don't agree on it because it is clearly proved in Pañcaratra.\nIt is not a very proper procedure to deny things that are proved by smṛti; since both śruti and smṛti spring from perfect knowledge, they are equally valid.\n\n[[82]]\n> The Author raises the question which one of two alternatives may be true:  \nAre these four equally and independently sovereign,  \nor has one a quaternity of personalities which he has assumed at his own desire?\n> and then he points out the defect: if they are equally sovereign, none of them can be effects because they are equal; when they are different forms of one, what is the purpose of this division?\n97\\. OBJECTION. The sūtra  vā tadapratiṣedhaḥ (215: BrS., 2\\.2\\.44\\.  ) is explained as ~~follows:~~ above.\nREFUTATION. That is not correct, because an alternative is impossible.\nFor no one who holds that there is a God theorizes that the world has several Gods, least of all the Pāñcarātrikas who hold that \"Vāsudeva is the ultimate material cause\".\nBut this one Bhagavān, who has divided Himself into four for reasons of sport, protects the entire world.\nAnd this position is not unjustified, because it is justified in the same manner as the appearance of second-born and first-born brothers like Bala and Bharata.\nFor just as the Bhagavān, who has created the variety of phenomena of ether, Wind, Śiva, Brahmā etc. for His sport, whose sole motivation is the sport of his unfathomable power, has voluntarily assumed the personalities of Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa, Bharata, Śatrughna etc., without there being the possibility of logical conflict in the same manner the divisions of Saṅkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha, too, are unconflicting.\n\n[[83]]\n98\\. Furthermore, vipratiṣedhāt 216 may mean \"because of conflict with Revelation\",  \non the basis of the citation \"failing to find in the four Vedas...\"  \nor \"because of mutual conflict between the Tantras themselves\". \n\n216: BrS., 2\\.2\\.45\\.\nThe former alternative, incompatibility with Revelation has already been refuted as being without valid basis.\nMutual conflict between the Pañcarātra Tantras themselves, whose terminological precision has been perfected by the rules of logic governing principal matter, generality, peculiarity, quality and the like, does not exist.\nOn the other hand, statements that lack the corroboration of logic can have no cogency; \n\nas the maxim says: \n\n> \"A statement must have precision perfected by logic before it can communicate its meaning.\"\nConsequently, the Author of the Sūtras gives the lie to those exegetes who,  \nby superimposing on the Pañcarātra Tantras  \n(whose validity he strongly affirms as no less than that of the Vedas, in such assertions as \"idaṃ mahopaniṣadam,\" etc.)  \nthe non-existent doctrine of the soul's origination,  \nexplain that the sūtra means to reject the Pañcaratra Tantras. \n\nEnough."

                                "commentary": "99\\. The meaning of the Sūtras is this. First the Author has set forth that the doctrines of Kapila, Kaśyapa, Buddha, Jina and Paśupati,  \nwho oppose the Author's own accepted doctrine, are unnatural217 because they conflict with Revelation and logic. \n\n217: In BrS., 2,2\\.  \n218: āsamañjasya, taken from BrS., 2\\.2\\.37\\.\nNow, in order to remove the suspicion that the Pancarãtra Tantras (which are his own accepted doctrine) are equally unnatural with the other doctrines because their usual enumeration on an equal plane with the others has made them closely associated with them in people's thinking, he elicits their validity.\nIn the first two Sūtras the prima-facie case is laid down:\nthe Pancarãtra likewise has no validity, utpattyasaṃbhavāt, i.e., on account of the impossibility of Saṅkarṣaṇa's origination which is taught there.\n> Why should it be impossible? Because it cannot be established in either of two possible cases;\n> either the four vyūhas are equally sovereign, or else one God exists in four persons; and in either case there is impossibility of origination.\n> If they are equally sovereign, they cannot be created because they are equal; if only one being is admitted no origination is possible either, since a distribution within one being of creating and created parts is inconceivable.\n[[84]]\n\n> 100\\. Similarly na ca kartuḥ karaṇam: Pañcarātra has no validity for the further reason that it is impossible that the instrument, sc. the mind called Pradyumna, originates from the agent, sc. the individual soul called Saṅkarṣaṇa, for the hatchet does not originate from Devadatta.\n> Or there is this alternative explanation of na ca kartuḥ karaṇam:  \nand for the further reason that the instrument does not originate from the agent Saṅkarṣaṇa,  \nsince according to the text: \n> \n> > \"From it spring the vital air, the mind and all the senses,\"  \n> \n> it is revealed that all instruments really originate from Brahman.\n101\\. Then follows: vijñānādibhāve vā tadapratiṣedhaḥ.  \nBy the particle va this prima-facie case is now reversed.\nWhat has been said, viz., that there is no validity since in neither case origination of Saṅkarṣaṇa etc. is possible, is untrue:\nit is not contradictory that Saṅkarṣaṇa etc. have originated.\nIndeed, it would be contradictory if they were not vijñānādi.\nVijñānādi is a dvandva compound: \"knowledge and beginning,\" that means: Brahman;   \nthus vijñānādibhāve means brahmabhāve.  \nInasmuch as they are Brahman (brahmabhāve), the origination is not contradictory.\nThat is to say by virtue of the fact that the unique Supreme Soul Vāsudeva, whose omnipotence is unbounded, enters into them through His māyā, a cause-effect relation is justified.\nThe objection that the mind cannot originate from Saṅkarṣaṇa, on the authority of the śruti that the mind originates from Brahman, is invalidated by the fact that he, sc. Saṅkarṣaṇa is vijñānādi, i.e., Brahman.\n\n[[85]]\n102\\. Furthermore, what is being said in the argument na ca kartuḥ karaṇam?\nIs it that the instrument of a certain action does not originate from the agent of that same action;  \nor that no instrument of any action whatever originates from any agent whatsoever?\nIf the first view is taken, we have a conflict with Inference, because the argument contains the fallacy of proving the proved.  \n\nThe mind, originating from the agent Saṅkarṣaṇa cannot be the instrument of Saṅkarṣaṇa's action of originating it,  \nsince it itself is the object of the action;  \n\nnor can it be the instrument of the action of being originated, since it itself is the agent of that action.\nIf the alternative view is taken, we have a conflict with Perception, because we see that for instance a pitcher, though it be the instrument of an action of fetching water, yet originates from the agent of such an action, the potter.\nThis the Author says in the sūtra vipratiṣedhāt: 'because there is conflict.'\n[[86]]\n\n103\\. ~~As to the other explanation that has been given of these two Sūtras,219~~ \n\n~~219: supra §§96, 97\\.~~\nsince it is vijñānādi, i.e. \"a ground for validity\",220 the denial of the validity of Pāñcarātra is not justified, because it entails overextension.\nThe invalidity, which is defined by the non-origination of knowledge through repetition or dubiety in the Tantras, is rejected, because vijnAna is taken up here ~~knowledge is actually had from them.~~\nIn order to remove the suspicion of untruth occasioned by the speaker's character, the word ādi is used to convey the intended meaning that the Tantras are in fact spoken by a trustworthy person.\nConsequently the meaning is this: He always has direct knowledge of the entire world by virtue of the omniscience which is part of His nature; He bestows man's wishes upon him, when He is satisfied—and he is satisfied by meditation alone; Him the experts in the Veda describe as eternally satisfied in all His desires: how then can there be defects in Him like error, deceit etc.?\n104\\. The 'impossibility of origination,' which has been stated in the first two Sūtras, is thereupon denied for Saṅkarṣaṇa and the other forms of God in the sūtra vipratiṣedhāt.\nThis means either; \"Because there is conflict with the Bhagavān's perception which is inferred through Pañcaratra;\" or \"Because there is conflict with Śruti which is inferred from the same Tradition.\"\n\n[[87]]\n105\\. Or there is another interpretation: since the Sūtras intend to illustrate the rules of exegesis, the author first assumes that there is a conflict between Śruti and Pañcaratra, though in fact there is no such conflict, and then reasons this out as follows:\nsuppose that Pañcaratra is in conflict with the veda, is this śāstra then, like the statements of Manu etc., valid or invalid?\nThis question is thereupon answered: \"It is invalid, because of the impossibility of the origination of valid knowledge concerning a conflicting sense;  \nand this impossibility itself is proved on the ground that there is independence of something that is dependent.\"\nThus the sūtra utpattyasaṃbhavāt means: \n\n\"because it is impossible that a valid knowledge originates,  \nsince, as long as the dependent Pañcaratra Tradition does not start proving the validity of its own sense by establishing the validity of its basis,  \n\nthe cognition which originates from the independent preterpersonal scripture  \ndetermines the Tradition's sense as being different,  \nand consequently conflicting with itself.\nFor Pāñcarātra conveys that scripture is its basis only as long as the sword of direct scripture does not cut its root.\n> 106\\. OBJECTION. But why should the Vedas themselves be independent, since their validity, too, depends on the direct cognition of the Bhagavān, because this cognition is their cause?221 \n\n221: cf. supra § 18\\.\n$ This is the contention of the Naiyāyika. He does not accept the \"apauruṣeyatva\" of the Vedas. They, according to him, are dependent upon the Supreme Being, like the Pāñcarātrāgamas, for their validity, so much so they too are \"pauruṣeya \", i.e., composed by the Divine Person. This is the point on which Yamuna differs from the Naiyayika. The aphorism \"na ca kartuḥ harapum\" ( Brahmasūtra II. ii. 40 ) is ingeniously interpreted by Yāmuna to elute the above concept of the Logician, and to establish the \"apauruṣe- vatva \" or the revealed character of the Vedas.\nJust as the Pāñcarātra Traditions are dependent on His cognition, so are the Vedas too dependent on His cognition.\nREFUTATION. To refute this view, the statement is made: \n\n> na ca kartuḥ karaṇam:  \n\n> The Vedas are not the product of a maker, i.e. the Bhagavān. \n\nKaraṇa here in the sense of \"things that are made or produced\",  \nby the rule \"suffix lyuṭ\" in the sense of the object of the action.  \nThis then means that the Vedas are preterhuman.\n\n222: Karmaṇi Lyuṭ Pāṇini.  \n\n[[88]]\n107\\. Vijñānādibhāve vā tadapratiṣedhaḥ.\n~~If, on the other hand,~~ it is not true that the Pāñcarātra Śāstra is invalid,\nthen what? tadapratiṣedhaḥ,\ni e. non-rejection of the origination of valid knowledge (namely, even when partly conflicting, the conflicting statement may be valid optionally),\nbecause it is based upon the direct cognition of the Bhagavān in whom error and deceit are impossible as He is a source of vijñāna (vijñānādibhāve):\nVijñāna means \"knowledge par excellence in which no mistake is possible.\nFor since all other authors of Dharmaśāstras are not omniscient, as they are involved in saṃsāra, and since therefore they are also not entirely self-sufficient,  \nvarious lapses are conceivable in their knowledge.\nWhereas in the case of the Bhagavān, whose supremacy is natural and unlimited, His knowledge is the immediate insight in all dharma and adharma, which is natural to Him and true, as is known from hundreds of śrutis; it is this knowledge which in the sūtra is described as vijñāna,\nWhen such knowledge is the 'beginning,' i.e. the basis, there is non-rejection, sc. the śāstra is valid."

                                "commentary": "108\\. OBJECTION. But how can it be assumed that the Tantra,  \nwhich conflicts with scripture, has validity?\nFor if it is valid,  \nit becomes optional beside 89 scripture;\nand optionality is deficient in the case of the Tantras by eight defects.\nOption is assumed  \nwhen there is no invariable rule that something should be such and not otherwise,  \nbecause there is no reason to reject, in one case or another, an alternative statement;  \nfor instance: \"He must sacrifice with rice,\"  \nbeside \"he must sacrifice with barley.\"\nIn the latter case it is impossible to eliminate one or the other  \nbecause both ~~neither~~ of these statements is characterized by independence.\nIn the former case, however, there can be no such option between scripture and Pafcarātra,  \nbecause the two are not equal;\nfor the Vedic statement is independent, because it is preterhuman,  \nwhereas the Pañcaratra statement is dependent.  \nSo how can they be alternatives and optional?\n109\\. REFUTATION. Listen: because Pañcarātra too is independent.\nOBJECTION. How can a statement deriving from a person be independent?\nREFUTATION.  \nLet us ask the logician to explain this-  \nmust dependence on something else  \nbe assumed for a statement to be informative,  \nto give positive certainty,  \nor to state the truth about its content,  \nor to serve a purpose of human importance?  \nAll four are impossible.\nWhen the statement is heard,  \n\"One must worship the Bhagavan with the attendance due an emperor,\" (not identified)  \nnothing else is required for this statement to be informative,  \nbecause the meaning of the words has already become known from other contexts.\nNor does this small measure of dependence prove the weakness of the statement's [[90]] validity, for the same weakness would follow for śruthi too.\nNor is anything else required for the statement to give positive certainty;  \nfor the statement \"One must worship....\" does not occasion doubt  \nwhether one must or must not worship,  \nsince that would entail a negation of the direct declaration of the real sense.\nNor is anything required for the statement to be true to the facts,  \nfor the knowledge produced by the statement does not require anything outside its own cause226 to be true to the facts,  \nbecause secondary validity is inappropriate and not admitted.\nNor is it necessary for the statement to be dependent on something else  \nin order to serve a purpose of human importance,  \nfor the proof of this purpose follows from a consideration of the entire body of doctrine.\nIn this case, those who have undergone the afore-mentioned sacraments have knowledge of the content of the statement  \nwhen they have heard the doctrine,  \nand hence they perform the \"five-timesa-day\" rites ([228]: Vaisnava rite observed five times a day: pañcakálika.), which form this content,  \nand hence they attain to supreme perfection;  \nthis is learnt solely from the Sastra itself.\n110\\. Or if the objection is raised that,  \ngranted the self-validity of Pañcaratra,  \nthis validity is not complete  \nas long as it has not been made certain  \nthat there are no defects,  \nafter it has been made certain that the speaker is reliable,-\nI reply that this view is not correct;  \nknowledge that there are no defects does not completely establish validity,  \nsince the validity arises from the cause itself of defectless knowledge  \nand not from the defectlessness of this knowledge.\n[[91]] 111\\. Nor is positive certainty about such of the speaker's qualities as his reliability  \nrequired for his statement to be defectless,  \nbecause the statement's defectlessness is proved solely by its being defectless.\nAs the Author of the Varttika declares, \n\n> \"Then the qualities (of the speaker) do not exert any influence (on the validity of his statement)  \nbecause (its defectlessness) is already known.\"229 \n\n[229]: ślokavārttika, 2.6 7 ab.\nThe same Author also shows that,  \neven when there is certainty about its defectlessness,  \nthe existence of qualities (like reliability in the speaker) is helpful:  \n\n> \"When defectlessness is known,  \nthey are helpful by merely existing.\" \n\n[230]: ib. 2.67 cd.\nNor does the validity, when it has been established  \nrequire something else in order that  \nconsequent actions of acceptance, rejection etc. proceed,  \nbecause action proceeds on the basis of recollection and desire.\nAs they say, \n\n> \"Action proceeds on the basis of recollection and desire.\" \n\n[231]: not identified.\nMoreover, in the case of the self-valid Vedas, too,  \nwe find this same dependence in that their validity would not be completely established  \nas long as there were no certainty of their defectlessness  \nafter the certainty about the non-existence of their author.\n> 112\\. OBJECTION. But when the non-existence of their author is proved without effort  \nby the non-apprehension of what ought to be there,  \nthe question of the non-validity does not arise for the Veda, for defects are impossible without something or someone in which they could reside.\nAs they say: \n\n> \"In that case (the Veda) the absence of non-validity follows quite naturally from the absence of an author;  \ntherefore its validity cannot be questioned.\"\\*\\*\" \n\n[[92]]\nREFUTATION. Why, in the case of Pañcarátra too no question can arise about its validity, since the absence of defects is easily proved by the fact that the omniscient and omnipotent God is its speaker; so the argument is the same.\nIn other words, in both cases of self-validity there is positive certainty that there are no defects; in the case of the Veda because there is positive certainty that no person is involved who could possess these defects; in the case of Pañcarātra because there is positive certainty that its speaker possesses virtues which preclude defects.\nIt is here as in the following two cases of absence of heat: there is no heat in ether because it is certain that there is no locus for heat in ether; nor is there heat in cold water because there is coldness which precludes heat.\n113\\. Moreover, neither dependence nor independence is by itself a cause of invalidation.29\nThe independent cognition that some substance is silver  \nwhile in reality it is nacre  \nis invalidated by the cognition: \"This is not silver:\"  \nthis cognition itself is considered as dependent. \n\n([233]: namely, because it requires another cognition in order to be denied.)\nThe cognition \"This is that flame,\" is found to be invalidated  \nby the inferential cognition that arises from the disappearance of oil\";  \nthe latter cognition itself is dependent because it arises from a sense-perception.\nThe simple truth therefore is  \nthat which is susceptible to invalidation  \nis invalidated by that which is not so susceptible;  \nin our present case there is no such susceptibility either of Scripture or of Pañcaratra.\n[[93]]  \n114\\. Or if you think that it is impossible to give positive certainty that the Tantra is promulgated by Vasudeva,  \nas it is in conflict with Scripture,\nI ask you :  \nWhy then does the knowledge arise that Scripture is preterpersonal,  \nwhile it is invalidated because it conflicts with Pañcaratra?\nThey accept it that the Veda is preterpersonal just because it is Veda; but then one can equally claim that Pañcaratra is promulgated by Vasudeva just because it is Pañcaratra.\nIf the preterpersonal origin of the Veda is proved by the fact that there is no recollection of an author, then why not agree that Pañcaratra is promulgated by Vasudeva just because there is recollection of his authorship?\nFor there exists a strong transmission of the recollection, extending to women and children, that Kesava is the author of the Pancarãtra.\nSo great a faith do people have in His authorship that they erect monuments according to the precepts of Pañcarātra, donating elephants, horses and great wealth in various fees,\nIn the Skanda Purana it is said that \"Kapila is the promulgator of Samkhya, Kesava of Pañcaratra.\"\nLikewise in the Mahabharata: \n\n> \"Narayana Himself is the promulgator of the entire Pañcaratra.  \nThis great Upanisada, consistent with the four Vedas,\n> as well as with the doctrines of Samkhya and Yoga, called Pañcaratra,  \nwhich was revealed by Nārāyaṇa's tongue,  \nhas been taught to the sages by Narada  \nas he had seen it and heard it in the abode of Brahma.\"\nFrom these and thousands of other statements in the Puranas, which are supported by the rules of interpretation, the conclusion follows naturally that Pañcaratra was indeed composed by Vasudeva Himself. \n\nOn the other hand, some experts dispute that the Veda is eternal! ([[142]] [235]: The Naiyayikas.) [[91]]\nTherefore, the real ground for the thesis that the validity of the doctrine of the Bhagavan and that of the Veda is above question  \nis this that both are causes of defectless knowledge.\nConsequently, because both are equally exemplary, they are optionally valid. It is with this view in mind that the wise Author of the Sūtras has explained: vijñanādibhave vaa tadapratiṣedhah.\nnotes: in order to understand any statement, one must first know the meaning of the words that compose it;  \nthis may be called dependence,  \nso that to this extent any statement is dependent for its informativeness on other and prior knowledge;  \nbut this must also apply to Vedic statements.\nnotes: If the cause (here: God) is above suspicion, the statement will be accurate.\n\ngunataḥ prāmāṇyasyājuktateūd anabhjupagamãe; my understanding is that a statement has its validity by itself,  \nand no secondary validity in the sense that its content must first be validated by some other means.  \nThe validity itself must be proved (namely by the character of the personal author or by its preterpersonal origin), but once proved, the statement itself is valid."

However, granted that error is made inconceivable by the Bhagavan's omniscience,  \nyet, since He is also omnipotent,  \nHe can also have composed the Pancarātra in order to deceive.  \nNow, when people, considering this possibility, are confused in their minds as to  \nwhich view they should take,  \nthat this Sastra has been promulgated to deceive them,  \nor that it has been stated according to the truth with complete attentiveness of mind,\n> what way is there to resolve their dilemma? We should prefer to decide that since it militates against Scripture it results in disaster.\nREFUTATION. To this objection the Author replies vipratisedhat, i.e., on account of the contradiction of all śruti, epic, purana and worldly experience.\nIf, without any reason, merely because the Bhagavan is omnipotent, the question is raised  \nif He might bave intended to ruin His devotees,\nwhy, then one could also raise the question whether He would not hurl even the virtuous into hell by a whim of His omnipotence and consequently the whole world would fall into inactivity!\n[[95]] \n\nBesides, we could also raise the question whether He did not wish to deceive people, because He is omnipotent, and thus created in the beginning the Vedas themselves with false meanings, which are also suprasensible, took away from Brahma etc. also the power of recollecting that He was the creator of the Vedas,  \nand from then onward set in motion the transmission of Vedic instruction until the present day:  \nhow can we be sure about it?\nOr the position can be taken that  \nsince there is no evidence that,  \nwhile He is indeed omnipotent,  \nHe acted up to the full measure of His omnipotence,\nsince there is no purpose for Him to deceive people  \nbecause He is satisfied in all His desires,\nand since He is not in the least affected by defects of partiality and cruelty etc.\nbecause He abides with natural affection for all living beings;\n> and since, if He had composed ~~the Pañcaratra~~ in order to deceive, \nit would be impossible to demonstrate that  \nthe wise men who, up to now, learn its instructions  \nand perform the contents of these instructions  \nhave forgotten the defects of its author,  \nit must follow that such a suspicion does not arise; \n\nand if this view is taken, all this will equally apply to the other ~~Vedas~~ as well.\nTherefore,\nwhat possible purpose could He who is satisfied in all His desires,  \nwho is omniscient and a treasury of compassion  \nhave in deceiving the poor people  \nwho have failed to understand the meaning (of the Veda)?\nOr how could the supreme sages everywhere praise the Tantra as being equal to the Upanisads,  \nif it had been composed in order to deceive?\nFor thus the saints declare in Vārāha Purana, the Ramayana and the Bharata etc. that this Tantra is an equally esoteric doctrine as the Vedas; and we declare the same.\n[[96]]\n\n> \"Through Veda, Pañcaratra, through devotion and sacrifice, O Brahmin, I can be attained,  \nand not in any other way, even in hundreds of lacs of years.\n> If one among thousands will grasp the Pañcarātra and,  \nat the expiry of his karman, will die my devotee, the Vedas and the Pañcarātra will dwell in his heart forever.237\n\n[237]: not identified.\n> This supreme Pañcarātra doctrine of mine, which is not difficult to grasp, that you shall reach to all the world by my grace, doubtless.25 \n\n[238]: not identified.\n> The Yogins mediate upon the Eternal One with Puranas, Vedas and Pañcaratras, and worship Him with the proper rites.\n> Thus Samkhya and Yoga on the one hand, and Veda and Aranyaka on the other hand are one and the same; all together they are the members that constitute Pañcaratra\n> O excellent one! He who sees through Veda and Pañcaratra sees truly; this great Upanisada, consistent with the four Vedas....\"\nSince the number of these and similar statements is infinite, we stop here. If you still raise the question if there cannot be ruin in such a Tantra,  \nthen there can be no faith in anything. It is with this view in mind that the Author sets forth:\nvipratisedAt."

The contention has been voiced that Pañcarātra is invalid because it is accepted by those who are outside the Veda.\"  \nBut why could one not equally well contend that the Vedas are invalid  \nbecause they are accepted by those who are outside Pancarātra?\nFurthermore, what exactly does this mean, being \"outside the Veda,\"  \nand what means \"accepted by those who are outside the Veda?\"  \nDoes \"being outside the Veda\" mean  \n\"being different from the Veda\"  \nor \"doing what is forbidden by the Veda\"  \nor \"being hostile to the Vedas?\"\nLikewise we must inquire whether \"accepted\" means learnt\" or \"known\" or \"observed.\"  \nIn all  cases the ground proves to be defective, 35\nFirst of all, if \"outside the Veda\" means \"different from the Veda,\"  \nand \"accepted\" means \"learnt\",  \nthen the ground proves to be occasional,  \nsince it equally applies to the Vedas themselves :  \nthe Vedic statements, which are valid,  \nare \"learnt\" by members of the three estates,  \nwhich themselves are \"different from the Veda.\"\nIf you take \"accepted\" to mean \"known,\" you do not get rid of the same defect.\nIf the term \"outside the Veda\" means \"different from the Veda,\"  \nand \"accepted\" means \"observed,\"  \nthen there would likewise be an occasional application of the ground to the Vedas themselves.\nIf \"outside the Veda\" is taken to mean \"performing forbidden acts,\" \nthe ground has an occasional application to those statements of the Veda  \nwhich enjoin expiatory ceremonies. ([241]: Manusmrti, 8.107.)\nFor since statements enjoining expiations, e.g. \"One must sacrifice with the kusmanda verses,\"  \nwhose content is to be \"learnt\", \"known\" and \"observed,\" by those who perform forbidden acts, are authoritative,  \nit would follow that the ground \"because they are accepted by people outside the Veda\" is occasional,242\nNor are the Pañcaratra Tantras invalid  \nbecause they are \"accepted\" by people hostile to the Veda,  \nfor the ground is unproved.\nBesides, acceptance by people hostile to the Veda does not by itself refute the validity of what is accepted. +++(5)+++\nIf it did, the Path of the Heretics would be unbarred;  \nfor they endeavour to uproot the validity of the Veda.\nThus the naked Jainas could effortlessly render the Vedas untruthful  \nsimply by accepting\" the Vedas in some manner by way of deception.\n118\\. OBJECTION, A consideration of such statements as \"He should never use the Veda, except at a funerary offering,\" (Manusmrti) shows that the defect affects only the unqualified students, not the defectless Vedic statements themselves.\nREPLY. Then the defect affects only the unqualified students in the case of the Tantras under discussion as well,  \nand not the defectless Tantras themselves;  \nso everything is the same, depending on what partisan view one takes.\n244 Or if it be held that \"outside the Veda\" means \"unqualified to perform Vedic acts,\"  \nand that Pañcaratra is invalid, like the caityavandana statements,\"  \nbecause it is accepted by those who, being unqualified, are outside the Veda,\nthe following distinction must be 99 considered  \nis the ground here that the Tantras are accepted by people unqualified for all Vedic rites,  \nor by people who are unqualified for some Vedic rites?  \nThis point should be clarified.\nNow, the first alternative cannot be adopted,  \nbecause the ground is not proved.  \nFor there is no human being who is not qualified for any shrauta rite whatsoever, e.g. non-violence etc.,  \nbecause his humanity as such provides his qualification.  \nOtherwise candālas etc. would do no wrong  \nif they committed such crimes a brahmin-murder, theft of brahmin wealth, miscegenation with caste-women, study of the Veda etc.,  \nsimply because they were not qualified to observe these prohibitions.\nIf a man does something he should not do,  \nhe commits an offence.\nIt follows that everybody is qualified to these Vedic rites,243  \nwhich shows that the ground is not proved  \nand that the illustration falls short of the means of proof.\nin one sense.\n\nFor the observance of a prohibition is as much a ritual action as the observance of an injunction.\nNor can the second alternative be adopted  \nthat the Tantras are invalid because they are accepted by people  \nwho are unqualified for certain Vedic rites,  \nbecause that would entail the conclusion that all Vedic statements are invalid.\nFor every man has some Vedic rites for which he is not qualified:  \nthe brahmin is not qualified for the Royal Consecration,  \nthe ksatriya not for the ritual drinking of soma.\nConsequently, this ground has an occasional application to the Vedic statements,  \nwhich are accepted by qualified persons belonging to the three estates,  \nand is therefore inconclusive.\nAs to the illustration,  \nthe view that heaven is attained by worshipping a caitya  \nis not invalidated by its being accepted by heretics,  \nbut by the deficiency of its cause, [[100]]\n119\\. We have already said that Pancarâtra has been accepted by the Vedic, and among all orthodox pre-eminent, sages Bhṛgu, Bharadvāja, Dvaipāyaṇa etc.\nAnd in the present day we can also observe how exemplary persons of great learning,  \nbelieving that these rites are most effective in attaining bliss,  \nperform the rites of temple-building, erection of idols, prostration, circumambulation and particular festival ceremonies,  \njust as they perform the agnihotra and other rituals enjoined directly by Scripture.\nAnd it is improper to maintain that their conduct has no foundation,  \nfor that would entail that such smārta rites as crepuscular worship, astaka etc., are similarly without foundation.\nIt has been said that the conduct of exemplary people is authoritative,26  \nand also that even when they do not know the cause of their custom,  \nthey do know what is proper custom.\n120\\. If the ground for the invalidity of Pañcaratra is that it is accepted by Bhagavatas, well, then the scriptural statements of the Ekayana Sakha and the Vājasaneyaka sakhas and the means of knowledge Perception, Inference etc., would also be invalid since the Bhagavatas accept those too!\nThis same ground, moreover, namely that Pancarãtra is invalid because it is accepted by the Bhagavatas, suffers from two defects; it is both specially-occasional and unproved.249\nWhy is Pañcarātra rendered invalid by their acceptance?\nIf it is because they do not belong to the three estates,  \nthen the Atharvanic statements whose content is accepted and observed by rathakaras, nisadas and other groups  \nwhich do not belong to the three estates  \n(Statements like \"The rathakara must add fuel,\"  \n\"With [[101]] that he must sacrifice for the chief of the Nişādas,\" etc.)  \nwould also be invalid.\nOr, be it granted that the acceptance of certain rites by outcastes renders them invalid;  \nyet, in view of the fact that the eminent brahminhood of these Bhagavatas  \nwho follow the doctrine of the Bhagavān  \nis evident by all criteria of knowledge,  \ntheir acceptance of Pañcaratra rather confirms its validity.\nnotes: People who do prohibited acts follow Vedic expiations; but if acceptance by people who commit forbidden acts is sufficient to deny the validity of what they accept, this means that the validity of the Veda would be denied.\nnotes: supra § 17: this Buddhist injunction is outside the Veda"

                                "commentary": "He says: By the same means of knowledge by which the brahminhood of one set of people is evident  \nthe brahminhood of another set of people is evident.\n121\\. OBJECTION. But when one sees the small sons of the twice-born who wear the customary hairtuft, sacred thread, palasa wood stick and munjagrass girdle, one knows, the moment the eyes fall on them, that they are brahmins.\nREFUTATION. And in our case, when one sees learned people who day after day study the Vajasaneyaka and Ekāyana śākhās, wear prominently their sacred threads, upper garments and hairtufts, impart teaching, sacrifice, receive priestly stipends---does one not instantly know that they are brahmins?\nIf it be held that outcastes, low-caste people etc., may also illegitimately sacrifice, teach, carry palata sticks etc. and that they behave as though they were legitimate brahmins, and that therefore neither costume nor conduct provides positive certainty that a man is a brahmin, then the same applies to other priests than Bhagavatas.\nOr be it granted that there are cases where people illegitimately display the marks of brahminhood;  \nstill, [[102]] though there may be doubt about the legitimacy of these marks in others because of their resemblance to pretenders  \n(just as when there is a doubt that one may be mistaken about real silver too because one has mistaken nacre for silver),  \nthen there can be certainty of their being genuine brahmins  \nin all cases when no misapprehension occurs,  \nbecause otherwise doubt would conflict with Perception  \nand lead to infinite regress.\n122\\. Or if it be held that the others are genuine brahmins because they recollect those gotras which are peculiar to brahmins, the same applies to the Bhagavatas;\nfor the Bhagavatas have the tradition: \"We are descendants of Bharadvaja, of Kasyapa, of Gotama, of Upagava.\"\nNor is this recollection or tradition of gotras unfounded or merely contemporary, for the same can be argued for all tradition of gotras.\nIf there were doubt about descent since error could conceivably occur,  \nthis would confuse the whole world about the authenticity of their brahminhood.\nAfter all, anyone may fear that he really is a candala  \nif he suspects his mother of having had a lover;   \nand how, my excellent opponent, can you be quite sure yourself that your birth entitled you to Veda-study?\nTherefore if the brahminhood of Bhagavatas,  \nwhich is completely established by the recollection of the various gotras  \nwhich has been passed on in uninterrupted transmission, stands unchallenged,  \nthen there is no difference whatever in this  \nbetween the brahminhood of Bhagavatas and of others.\n123\\. Further, if some who believe in the Supreme Person are monotheists and others who believe in [[103]] petty godlings are polytheists,  \n\nis then the same authority stated for the brahminhood of the ones as well as of the others,\nor how else is their brahminhood known  \nif not by that same authority?\nIf this is the question, then listen:  \nthere remains a criterion to determine brahminhood in either case,  \neither Perception, or Inference, or Circumstantial-Implication.\n> 124\\. OBJECTION. But how can Perception convey that they are brahmins?\n> For when we are close to two individuals whom we have not seen before, one a brahmin, the other a ksatriya, of the same age and the same appearance, we do not immediately observe the distinction that one is a brahmin and the other a ksatriya in the same way as we instantly observe the differentness of a goat, an elephant, a buffalo etc.\n> Nor is it proper to maintain that  \n>\n> > the visual sense conveys the brahminhood of a nearby individual  \nin dependence on our recollection of his father's brahminhood etc.;  \nfor that recollection itself is impossible without a previous immediate cognition,  \njust as the recollection of the son of a sterile mother is impossible.\n> Nor can we know from Inference that a man is a brahmin,  \nfor we do not find a concomitant mark.\nAnd such qualities as tranquillity, self-restraint, austerity, purity etc., cannot be taken as marks of brahminhood, because they are available only in the case of a good brahmin and because they are not exclusively confined to brahmins.\n> Nor can Circumstantial-Implication furnish proof of brahminhood,  \nbecause it is not lacking in reason\n> [[104]]  \nand the fact that the sentence-meaning of the statement, \n> \n> > \"In spring the brahmin must add fuel to the fire,\" \n>\n> is otherwise unestablished  \ndoes not therefore by Circumstantial-Implication  \nfurnish proof that a man is a brahmin;  \nfor knowledge of that sentencemeaning presupposes knowledge of the word-meaning of brahminhood etc.\n125\\. REFUTATION. All this does not make for a defect in my argument.\nThere is no invariable rule that  \nPerception becomes manifest only at the first contact between sense and object and not otherwise.\nPerception is that which illumines the unmanifest  \nwhile there is continuity of the operation of the senses.\nThus there can be Perception of brahminhood;\nfor when we keep our eyes open we note,  \nimmediately upon observing the particular differentiae of the genus brahminhood,  \nthat the brahminhood is quite clearly noticeable in those who belong to the families of the different gotras-Vasistha, Kasyapiya Sathamarṣaṇa etc.--,  \nwho are pure in their conduct,  \nand who display the sacred thread, upper cloth, hairtuft and munja grass girdle.\nNor does it run counter to ordinary experience that the eyes can convey brahminhood in dependence on the observation of the peculiarities of genus.\nevery case the sense becomes the cause of the rise of determination of sense-object when favoured by the accompanying circumstances of place, time, configuration etc.\nIt is the natural function of the sense-organ as such to relate itself to these accompanying circumstances.\nAs the author says: \n\n> \"No organ of knowledge, whether in Veda or in ordinary process,  \nbecomes efficacious in determining the object  \nthat is to be realized through the accompanying circumstances  \nunless it is favoured by these circumstances.\n[[105]]  \nConsequently the visual sense, when favoured by the recollection of genus,  \ngives knowledge of brahminhood  \nwithout the object giving up its perceptuality.\nSo it is evident that the visual sense can be the instrument of knowledge of genus in dependence on a variety of accompanying factors.\nGold becomes manifest through its colour fromcopper etc., gheeis differentiated from oil, through its smell and taste;\nfire, which is hidden by ashes, perceived through touching the ashes.\n\nSound may provide us with proof that there is a horse in the distance;\na pitcher etc. are known through their configuration; brahminhood through descent, and also through conduct in certain particulars, which is completely protected by the king.\nIt has been contended that when we see two individuals of the same age and appearance, the difference between the two does not immediately appear to eye;  \nbut the perceptuality of their differentness is not refuted by just this.\nIn this case the non-perception of their differentness is caused by the defect of similarity.\nThe difference between nacre and silver, which are similar in appearance and configuration, may not be immediately visible, yet that does not mean that their difference is not visible at another time; and the same holds for the difference between brahmin, kṣatriya and vaisya.\nOr else, brahminhood is that which arises from the differentiae of genus,\nand such a product can empirically be known just like any other product  \nby a process of positive and negative consideration,\ne.g. \"what are the specific characteristics to which the elders apply the term brahminhood, or to which ~~characteristics~~ is the term applied?\"\n[[106]]  \nIt has been said often that it applies to those who possess recollection of gotra, Vedic ancestry etc.; let us not start discussing this question again, or we must repeat our old argument:  \n\nit is established that the Bhagavatas are brahmins, because they possess gotra etc.\n126\\. The objection that was made that the Bhāgavatas are born from a vaiśya vratya:\n([253]: supra § 15. [[143]]  )\n\n> \"The fifth one, the Sarvata, must worship the sanctuaries of Visnu by royal decree;\"\nand \n\n> \"he is also called a Bhagavata; he is born from a vaisya vratya.\" \n\n\\- On the authority of the two statements.\nTo this we reply:  \nprecisely what do we learn from these two statements?  \nIs there a simple connection of names,  \nor must an invariable rule be stated ?\n\n[254]: ie., is the same name used for several groups or only one?\nIn It is impossible to make it a rule that the words Bhagavata and Satvata denote a vaiśya vratya, for that is not known from the text, and it involves overextension.\nIn the statement, \"the fifth one, Satvata,\" we do not find a denial that the words Bhagavata and Satvata denote other meanings, for that would mean ignoring the explicit and inventing the unstated.\nIn our statement the fifth one,  \nwho is born from an vaisya vratya,  \nis understood to bear the name of Satvata:  \n\"The fifth one, Sarvata...\", since the word 'fifth' is the operative term as it is mentioned first.\nAnd if the fifth is the Satvata,  \nthe Satvata is not necessarily also be the fifth, namely the vaiśya vratya.\nFor when the stated subject (e.g. a mountain) is possessed of fire,  \nthe predicated fire does not necessarily possess smoke.255 \n\n255. The argument is: if S is P, then P is not therefore S.\n\nThe example is 'parvato 'gnimin dhumavattvāt if we interchange S and P, we get parvato dhumavin agnimattvåt, but this is not true, for though there is no fireless smoke, there is smokeless fire. Similarly here: the fifth may be a sitvata or a vaidya vratya, but being the fifth does not make the sitvata a vaidya vratya,\nConsequently the consideration if a smrti statement of this kind cannot give certainty that the words Satvata, Bhagavata etc mean vratya.\n127\\. If it be argued that since these two words also may denote another caste (namely of the vaisya vratyas),  \nthen the mere fact that certain brahmins are denoted by these words proves that these brahmins belong to that caste,  \neven though they follow the doctrine of the Bbagavan,  \nit would also follow that, since we find the collocated word acaryas also used to denote the issue of a lowly vaisya,  \ntherefore an eminent brahmin who is an acarya imparting teaching of the Veda with its ancillae and its esoteric teachings is thereby denoted as being a vaisya vratya!\nIf, on the other hand, even though a true brahmin is denoted by the word ācārya which dea vratya, there still can be no suspicion that he actually is a vratya, because there is positive certainty of his brabminhood which is clearly proved by other means of knowledge, and because it is possible that the word acarya is used figuratively (ācārya as one who \"accumulates\"— acinoti the pupil's knowledge) for a Brahmin teacher,\nthen in our case, too, the same argument can be made, namely thus: even though they are denoted by the terms Satvata and Bhagavata, which denote another caste, yet there can rise no suspicion that they actually are vratyas, because the brahminhood of these followers of the Bhagavan's doctrine is firmly known from the recollection of completely obvious clans, Vedic ancestry etc., and because it is possible that the terms Sātvata and Bhāgavata have a figurative denotation of sattva-vat and bhaga-vat.\n\n(257, explained below, § 130.)\nIn other words, \n\nthe fact that the same word denotes both classes of people  \ndoes not mean that therefore both belong to one and the same caste,  \nlest the true brahmin be not made into a low-caste man because he is also denoted by the word AchArya.\nWe find that the word hari also means 'frog.' Does it follow that a lion is a frog because both are denoted by the same word? Then word itself would be horned, since 'word' is denoted by gau !\" \n\n([259]: gauḥ can mean 'cow' and 'word.\" )\nConsequently, just as the words sudhanvan, ācārya etc., which denote more than one meaning, are also used for someone born from a vaiśya vratya, so also the words Bhagavata and Satvata.\n128. The contention that when the conventional meaning and the etymological meaning of a word collide, it is right to assume the conventional meaning of the term, in this case of the terms Bhagavata and Satvata, \n\n[260]: supra §15.\nis not correct;  \nfor when a denotation is appropriate  \nwhich is the composite of the denotations of the component elements of the words,  \nthen it is not right to assume a non-composite denotation.\nFor he who theorizes that the words satvata and bhagavata have their conventional meaning  \nin denoting someone born from a vaisya vratya,  \nmust also theorize that the words sattvavat and bhagarut, which are the stem and the taddhita suffix built on the stem,261 have a different meaning in a sentence like, \"having observed the satvata rules, a man becomes a Bhagavata because of the merits he has won in a previous existence.\" 262\n\n[261]: taddhita suffix, cf. Panini.\n\n[262]: \"conventionally the two words are synonymous, 'etymologically' they have different meanings.\nThis goes to prove the assumption that  \nin this case the word may have a double meaning by etymology alone,  \nbecause it is possible for it to be used in the sense of \"issue of a vaisya vratya.\"\nAnd it is possible that those vratyas too, despite the fact that they fail to [[109]] worship the Bhagavan directly,  \nyet may be denoted by the words satvata and bhagavata,  \nbecause of their work discipline of cleaning up Vasudeva's temple,  \nclearing away the bali offerings,  \nguarding the idol etc., for it is taught that the can suffix may occur in the sense of a simple relation, \"this is of that.\" (263, Panini.)\nAnd it is declared that the issue of a vaiśya vratya has the work discipline of cleaning the Bhagavan's temple etc.,\n\"and (the task) of the satvatas is the cleaning of the deity's temple, the eating of the offerings, the guarding of the idol;\"\nand \"he must worship Visnu's sanctuaries.\"'264 \n\n([264]: quoted supra.)\n129\\. Herewith is also rejected the contention that the Bhāgavatas are vratyas because they would have the same profession.\nFor it is one thing to clean the temple, clear away the bali offerings, guard the idol,\nand quite another thing to perform the variety of actions that are daily observed by the Bhagavatas: ~~the cleaning of the way to the idol~~ approaching, the preparation for worship, offering, daily study, and meditation.  \nIt is as it is in the case of the jyotistoma etc.\nIn the jyotistoma, too, a carpenter has a task in making the various receptacles, soma-cups, soma-decanters, ladles etc., while the officiating priests have their tasks in reciting various different mantra recitations, representing the deity, pressing of the soma etc. +++(5)+++\nAnd this occupational similarity, limited as it is, does not raise the question whether the priests have the same caste as the carpenters!\nSo here, too, there is a difference between those who perform the pañcakālikā ritual, which is established by the Bhagavan's doctrine, and the low-caste people who do the cleaning-up of the temple and are also called temple-guards.\n[[110]]\n\n130\\. Further, the contention that, if the words bhāgavata and satvata have their etymological meaning, this entails that the word rathakara in the injunction the \"rathakara must build a fire\" desomeone belonging to the three varias on account of its etymology of chariot-making,268 is not correct. \n\n[268]: For the word means etymologically \"maker of chariots, carts.\"\" [269]: not identified.\nFor in the case of rathakāra  \nit is correct that the term refers to someone belonging to the three varṇas,  \nbecause otherwise the springtime etc.,  \nwhich are given in the statement on the origin of this fire-building, would be invalidated,  \nand because usages of a word in the sense of different castes, which is given in the mantra \n\n> \"saudhanvanā ṛbhavaḥ sūracakṣasaḥ\" \n\nwould be invalidated.\nDespite the fact that rathakāra is also a name for another caste-as learnt from the smṛti \n\n> \"the rathakāra is born out of a kāriṇī by a māhiṣya\"\nnevertheless, since, on Śaṅkha's evidence that ~~so that~~ the rathakāra is born from an anuloma marriage of a kṣatriya man and a vaiśya woman,265  \nthe rathakāra is not forbidden to perform rites of sacrificing, fire-building and initiation,266  \n\n265: supra § 15\\.  \n266: not identified.\nthere is no conflict of qualification for rites that can only be realized through knowledge of the Veda,267 \n\n267: which is the prerogative only of the three varṇas.\nand since the word rathakāra (in its etymological meaning) is inappropriate for members of the three varṇas  \nbecause they are forbidden to follow an artisan's profession,  \ntherefore we can only conclude that in both cases different castes are denoted by the term,\nand so there is no conflict (here).\nMoreover, when knowledge of the thing meant by a word is obtained from the denotation of the separate members that compose the word, then the Author of the Sūtras rules out the validity of a denotation in which the meanings of the component members are lost, namely in prokṣaṇīṣv arthasaṃyogāt. 268\n\n268: KMS.  \n\n[[111]]\nTherefore, those emine~nt brahmins are called sāttvatas and bhāgavatas who because of their pure character (sattva) devote themselves to the Bhagavān who is the Supreme Person.\nLater on we shall show that other smṛtis set forth the eminent brahminhood of the bhāgavatas.\n131\\. The further objection,269 namely why these people should invariably be denoted by the exclusive names of Sāttvata and Bhāgavata, if their brahminhood were the same as that of others, can be answered thus: there is no defect in that, for it is as it is in the case of the names parivrājaka and nigada. \n\n269: supra § 15\\.\nCertain brahmins are called bhāgavatas, just as certain brahmins are called parivrājakas, and certain yajuḥ formulae nigadas, though both are equally brahmins and equally yajuḥ formulae; namely in the statements:  \n\n> The brahmins should remain,  \nthe parivrājakas must be fetched; 270  \n\"the yajuḥ formulae take place, not the nigadas;  \nthe nigadas take place, not the yajuḥ formulae;\"271 \n\n270: not identified.  \n271: not identified.\nand this is so because of the interpretation: \n\n> \"the nigadas are the fourth mantra collection, or the yajuḥ formulae, because they are identical.\"\n132\\. The contention that the bhāgavatas are bad brahmins because they perform pūjā to the God, partake of the offering substance etc. for a livelihood, is countered in the following manner:\nSurely not all bhāgavatas worship Hari for their profession, for many Sātvatas are found who perform pūjā for themselves.\nIf there are certain people who, while being Sātvatas, follow a reprehensible profession and perform sacrifices for respectable bhāgavatas professionally,\nthis fact alone does not mean that one may say that they are not brahmins. A vedic priest who officiates as an adhvaryu at a jyotiṣṭoma does not thereby lose caste.\nIf the priest were not to receive fees, the pūjā itself would remain fruitless; they take fees in order to realize completely the excellence of the pūjā.\nAt the conclusion of the worship one must give gold to the priest according to capacity; otherwise the fruit will go to the pūjā priest himself,  \nas is shown by the smṛti: \"A sacrifice for which a small fee is given kills (the sacrificer).\"272 \n\n272: cf. Manu, 11\\.40\\.\nIt is however prohibited that a covetous Vedic priest officiate as a priest after he himself has put up his demands for a fee,\ne.g. in the statement: \n\n> (\"There is an error called 'garbage\"\").  \n> When the sacrificer appoints as an officiant priest  \nwho covets the office, thinking either  \n\"He should give me (a fee)\"  \nor \"He should choose me.\"  \n\"This is as far from the sacrificer as garbage; this does not benefit the sacrificer.\"273 \n\n273: AitBr., 3\\.46\\.\nThe donation of the sacerdotal fee which is purified by faith is felicitous for both,\nas according to the smṛti, \"He who receives the offering and he who {{deit|gives it}} both go to heaven.\"274\n\n274: not identified.  \n\n[[112]]\n133\\. The statements that professional worship of the deity and living off the god's treasure makes a man a devalaka275 \n\n275: supra § 16\\.\nmust be taken to refer to the professional worship of, and the living off the treasure of, other deities than Vāsudeva.\nThus the blessed Vyāsa: \"A devalaka is he who lives on Rudra etc.\"\nAnd there is also Śāṇḍilya's word: \n\n> \"All those who perform sacrifices professionally  \nand are also not consecrated  \nare the only ones who are traditionally known as karmadevalakas in this world, O sage.  \nOne should not touch them or consort with them for a year.\"\nLikewise: \n\n> \"Certain people who are karmadevalakas and kalpadevalakas are unqualified for ritual before the deity for a period of three years.\nThose brahmins who, without being consecrated, perform rites set forth in the Kalpa, either professionally or for the fame of it, are kalpadevalakas.\nOne must have pūjā offered by another professional priest who has been properly consecrated; (if) one is unable to worship the god oneself.   \nThis is the principal offering; in another manner it is secondary.\"\n\"In another manner,' that is to say, when it is done by a non-consecrated priest.\nThis the author elucidates: \n\n> \"The rite performed professionally by 'some priest who has not been properly consecrated is called of the lowest degree.\"\nBy considering these and a hundred similar smṛti statements we can be sure that living off the deity's treasure and professional pūjā offering of brahmins who go without the sacrament of consecration as established by Pañcaratra renders them sub-Brahmins and devalakas.276\n\n276: This and the following quotations could not be identified.  \n\n[[113]]\n134\\. As to the statement that the bhāgavatas cannot pass for exemplary persons because they make use of flower and food offerings, which practice is abhorred by exemplary persons, to this we say: what does the śrotriya 277 mean by left-over flowers and leftover food? \n\n277: a Brahman erudite in the Veda and following its observances.\nWhen he takes it only as the flowers and the cakes,278 he is contradicted by all the world, for nobody approves of wasting flowers and cakes. \n\n278: If he does not believe that God is present in the effigy, the offerings are obviously not used and cannot be characterized as left-overs. The priest's avoidance of them would simply amount to sinful waste.+++(4)+++\nAlso, a particularized prohibition is not in order, because it is not established.\nNo notion of a particularized thing occurs when the particularization is not determined;\nand here it is impossible to determine the particularization.\n> OBJECTION. Why should it be impossible, since the particularization is that it is forbidden to use food what has been offered up to the deity?\nREPLY. Are you now accepting the validity of Pañcaratra? For only when one admits that there is a deity present in the idols that are erected with the sacred formulae enjoined by Pañcaratra Tantra can one postulate that the particularization of the prohibition lies in the offering-up to the deity.\nFor unless the validity of the Tantra is admitted, how can an idol which is set forth in the Tantra be a deity, and, a fortiori, how can the substance that is offered up for this deity's sake be nirmālya and nivedya,\n> For a deity does not exist by just being a deity;  \nonly that deity which is known to be correlated with an oblation on the authority of scriptural testimony is the deity to that oblation; \n\nthat is your own doctrine.\nOr if it be held that \n\n> something is nirmālya and nivedya because it is admitted by the Pāñcarātrikas that it is offered up to the deity,\nwell, in that case you must also admit its purity because the Pāñcarātrikas accept also that the utilization of nirmālya and nivedya is perfectly pure.\nOr if you do not accept this peculiar excellence, since in your opinion the Pāñcarātrikas have accepted as pure something that is really impure,\n—well, in that case you must accept it that the substance which is offered up is not really nirmālya and nivedya, since then you opine that the Pañcarātrikas have adopted someone who is not really a deity by mistaking him for a deity!\nIn other words, inasmuch as the ~~offering up~~ abandonment of mere flowers, cakes etc. 289 is not approved,  \nand because it is impossible to particularize the prohibition of utilizing these substances according to the terms of one's own doctrine,  \ntherefore the particularization must be determined in the terms of the others', i.e. the Pañcarātrikas', doctrine;  \nand thus the offering up becomes greatly purifying.  \nAnd inasmuch as therefore the utilization of nirmālya and nivedya becomes most purifying,  \nit must needs be accepted by those who admit the validity of the Pañcarātra Tantra as well by others who do not.\n[[114]]\n\n> 135\\. OBJECTION. But how is it possible then that even one who admits the validity of Pāñcarātra  \nshould reject nevertheless the nirmālya and nivedya?\n> For in the Tantras the tasting etc. of the nirmālya is prohibited. For instance, it is said in the Sanatkumārīya Saṃhitā:\n> \"The offering that is proffered (to the deity), flower or fruit, is called nirmālya; that must be avoided meticulously.\"\n> Similarly in another passage: \"When one has eaten nirmālya, or the foodrests of someone who is not one's guru, one must observe a milk-vow for a month, continuously recite the eight-syllable formula, \nand drink the pañcagavya,279 in order to be purified.\" \n\n279: The {{pancagavya|pañcagavya}} is a substance in which the 5 products of the cow are mingled.\n> Likewise in the Indrarātra: \"One should not live off the Supreme God, nor eat the nirmālya offerings.\"\n> Also: \n> \n>>  \"And the nirmālya offerings are never fit for consumption.\"\n> Similarly in another Saṃhitā: \n> \n> > \"One should not eat the nirmālya offerings, nor smell them, nor step over them.\"\n> How then can one accept the purity of the utilization of the nirmālya when we thus know from several Saṃhitā that it is prohibited?\nREFUTATION. To this he says: The utilization of a proffered substance which has been offered up to the deity is not condemned if it is done ~~within~~ after a period of ten nāḍikās.280 \n\n280: one nāḍikā is a half muhūrta.\nThus in the same Indrarātra: \n\n> \"The wise one must let the offering-cake stand for ten nāḍikās. This period of time has been prescribed both for night and for day.\n> They condemn the nirmālya that has stood for ~~more~~ other than this period of time;  \nthereupon he must throw it in water, or in fire, or bury it in the ground.\"\n> OBJECTION. But what is said here is not to praise the tasting etc. of the nirmālya, but to prescribe that the substance of the cake pūjā is thrown away after a period of ten nāḍikās.\nIn the statement: \n\n> \"He must let the offering cake stand for over ten nāḍikās,” \n\nthe injunction is laid down that when the proffered flowers, cake etc. in general have been taken off as nirmālya,  \nbecause they have now fulfilled their ritual function,  \nthey must be kept by way of accessory pūjā rite for a period of ten nāḍikās.\n> And consequently even a study of the conclusions of your own Tantras shows that the touching etc. of the turmeric powder, the food offerings and the water used to clean the idol's feet is not established by Tantric doctrine. Now, where are you!\nREFUTATION. Where are you, loquacious debaters, witless fools who have been swallowed by your own tongue which plays around with a grain of knowledge! Your objection looks black and white at once, like the moon with its spots.  \nThis prohibition applies only to fools like you,\nsince all this is indeed to be observed by Vaiṣṇavas who are qualified to do so, and thus it is capable of wiping off a multitude of sins in the same way as the drinking of soma at a Vedic sacrifice;\nfor it is not to be touched by others, just as the puroḍaśa cake is not to be touched by dogs!\nThus in the Īśvara Saṃhitā, \n\n> \"It is difficult to find in this world a true votary of the lord, my son,  \nand, among those who are, it is even more difficult to find a disposition which is truly pure enough for the footwater, or to use the garlands etc. which have been mentioned in the doctrine,\n> Therefore, O six-faced One, all this which is purified by the formulae and the glance of the Bhagavān is forbidden to those who lack this disposition and are not votaries.\"\nAnd in another passage: \"The saffron, sandal, camphor and oils that have been taken off Viṣṇu's body are supremely purifying.\"\nLikewise in the Padmodbhava: \"He who wears the powder that is taken of Viṣṇu's body on his head obtains the fruit of a Horse Sacrifice and glories in Viṣṇu's heaven.\"\nSimilarly in the Īśvara Saṃhitā, \n\n> \"No blame should be put by statements arising from ignorance on all that is used, the perfume, flowers etc., (the water) of the idol's bath etc., and the curds, milk etc.\n> Those who condemn this divine purifying agent because they consider it nirmālya, those witless detractors of its power will go to hell.\"\nThe above statements which to the consecrated prohibit the use of nirmālya at the time mentioned in the time instruction must be understood to mean a time subsequent to that when the (offerings to) the chief of the Bhagavān's retinue281 is being used. \n\n281: Viśvaksena, to whom pūjā is performed after the main pūjā.\nSince the garlands, sandal etc, which are offered up to the Bhagavān, later on, after the Viśvaksena offering, become unfit to eat,\ntherefore the Sātvatas use the nivedya etc. before that time. Consequently the use of the nirmālya is a cause of excellence for the Sātvatas.\n[[118]]\n\n136\\. Moreover, it is our postulation that the exemplary people hold the nirmālya of other gods in contempt; this is postulated like the drinking of soma (which is good) because it is Vedic (in contrast to the drinking of liquor which is evil).\nSo I have said that those who do not accept the validity of the Bhagavān's doctrine are unable to determine what is nirmālya.\nWhen it is properly determined (namely according to the Bhagavān's doctrine) the Bhagavān's nirmālya proves to be extremely purifying, as is demonstrated by the statements of all Vedic teachers.\nIn a matter for which the only means of knowledge is verbal testimony, it must be so as verbal testimony says that it is. Unless one is deaf, one cannot say that there is no verbal testimony concerning it.\nFor instance it is said in the Brahma Purāṇa: \n\n> \"The nivedya of Viṣṇu is declared by the sages to be pure and fit for consumption; one who eats other nirmālya and nivedya must perform the cāndrāyaṇa in expiation.\n> The mālya which is taken from the body of Viṣṇu takes away evil and is holy.  \nHe who wears it on his head goes to supreme bliss.\"\nIt follows that the smṛti statement that a man who eats nirmālya and nivedya must perform the cāndrāyaṇa should be taken to bear upon the nirmālya of Rudra, Kālī etc.\n(282: Mahābhārata quotations not verifiable.  )\n\nThus in the Mahābhārata: \n\n> \"Meditating in one's heart upon Hari, one must offer food to Him with full attention, thereupon pick up this food again with the middlefinger and the thumb,\n> and then sacrifice it bit by bit, saying: \"Prāṇāya svāhā, Apānāya svāhā, Vyānāya svāhā, Udānāya svāhā, Samānāya svāhā.\"\nLikewise in another passage, \"what has been offered to the god must be given to a brahmacārin.\"\nThus in the Mahābhārata: \n\n> \"The saintly knowers of the Pañcaratra ate in his house that which had been left over by the Bhagavān, as a means to attain to bliss, as supreme nourishment.\"\nAnd likewise the blessed Śaunaka:  \n\"He himself eats the nivedya.\"\nHe who condemns Viṣṇu's nivedya, whose purity is proved by hundreds of similar smṛtis and which dispels the fear of rebirth, really ignores the statements of the smṛti because of his heterodoxy and ought to have his tongue cut off.\n\n[[119]]\n137\\. OBJECTION. But how can the nivedya be a means for the prāṇāgnihotra?283  \nThe exemplary people do not approve of a means for homa etc. for which ~~no building bricks are used.??~~ (no sacrifice has been made.) \n\n283: The ritual taking of food is considered a performance of the prāṇāgnihotra.\n> Nor can a substitution of another substance do duty as a homa, because he lives off food that has been obtained according to taste.\n> Nor can a substitution of another consumption be made to replace the nivedya,  \nfor scripture enjoins upon the twiceborn a meal in the evening and a meal in the morning,  \nas follows from the prohibition: \"One should not take food in between.\"\nREFUTATION. That is no defect, since the multitude of deities, like prāṇa etc. are revealed to be parts of Viṣṇu, in the same way as Viśvaksena, the chief of Viṣṇu's retinue.\nFor just as the flowers, cake etc., though proffered to the Bhagavān  \nbut actually given to Viśvaksena shows that.\nHe is familiar under various guises, or just as at a sacrifice the soma juice that is left over by the hotṛ is pure to the adhvaryu, so it is also with the nirmālya.284\n\n284: The hotṛ is the principal reciting priest at the soma sacrifice, the adhvaryu the main executive.\nMoreover, only scripture can be our criterion for what is to be eaten and what is not to be eaten. When it says that something is fit to be eaten, what injunction are we to invent ourselves?\nJust as the same rule governs both the periodical and the desiderative agnihotra, so the same rule governing the eating of the nivedya applies also to the prāṇāgnihotra.\n\n[[120]]\n138\\. As to the remark299 that from the observance of different sacraments,  \nfrom conception ceremony to cremation,  \nit follows that the Bhagavatas are not brahmins,  \nhere again ignorance is to blame.  \nIt is not your Honour's fault  \nthat the Bhagavatas, who have the Vājasanevasakha in the transmission of their family line,  \nobserve the sacraments of conception ceremony etc. according to the manner laid down by the grhyasutras of Katyayana etc.\nThose who perform the forty sacraments  \nwhich are enjoined by the Ekayana scripture  \nwhile giving up the dharmas of the Veda,  \nfrom the recitation of the gayatri onward, [[300]]  \nthey properly follow the rules laid down by the grhyasutras of their own sakha  \nand do not abdicate their brahminhood  \nbecause they fail to follow the rites of a different shakha;  \nsince otherwise it would follow that other brahmins too would forfeit their brahminhood because they fail to perform the rites enjoined by other [[121]] people's Sakha.\nFor everywhere among brahmins we find customs that differ according to birth, caraṇa, gotra, qualification etc.\nEven though one ritual is understood for all śākhās,  \nstill all the various dharmas relating to mutually different qualified performers  \ndo not all together accumulate in any one place.\nAnd the Aspirants who are distinct from those brahmins who are qualified for rites of the aindragneya etc.,  \nwhich are means leading to the enjoyment of rewards like heaven etc.,  \nas enjoined by the three Vedas,  \nand who themselves are qualified for the rites of the Ekayana,  \nrites which alone are the means of attaining to the Bhagavan,  \nviz. knowledge, cleansing the way to the Lord, preparation of worship and oblation, as enjoined by the Ekayana scripture, are brahmins too.  \nIt follows that the non-observance of certain rites enjoined by different sākhās  \ndoes not mean that either one forfeits his brahminhood-\nthat the Ekāyana sākhā is preterpersonal scripture has been enlarged upon in the Treatise on the Validity of Kasmira Agama,\\*  \nand is therefore here not further discussed.\nBut since it is quite obvious that the Bhagavatas, which we are discussing here,  \nare connected with the dharmas of the three Vedas, like the savitri recitation,  \nthere is no possible support for the suspicion  \nthat they are really vratyas  \nbecause they would have abandoned these Vedic dharmas."
